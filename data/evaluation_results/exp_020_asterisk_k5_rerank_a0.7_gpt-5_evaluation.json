Consumers\nwill be sent renewal notices describing the action needed, if any, to renew their coverage. To manage the\nvolume, consumers will maintain their regular renewal “cycles” so that approximately one out of 12 of the\npopulation will renew each month. Additional details about this timeline will be delivered when HHS\nannounces the end date of the PHE.\nCommunications\nAdditionally, a public education campaign has been initiated by NY State of Health, the state’s official\nMarketplace.

New York State routinely completes surveillance activities to evaluate compliance with the following\nappointment availability standards, (Medicaid Model Contract 15.2, Appointment Availability Standards):\n• For urgent care: within twenty-four (24) hours of request.\n• Non-urgent “sick” visit: within forty-eight (48) to seventy-two (72) hours of request, as clinically indicated.\n• Routine non-urgent, preventive appointments except as otherwise provided in this Section: within four\n(4) weeks of request.\n• Initial prenatal visit: within three (3) weeks during first trimester, within two (2) weeks during the second\ntrimester and within one (1) week during the third trimester.\n• Adult baseline and routine physicals: within twelve (12) weeks from enrollment.\n• Well child care: within four (4) weeks of a request;\n• Initial family planning visits: within two (2) weeks of request.\n• Members must reach a live voice when calling a provider after-hours (i.e., an answering service).\nMMC Plans must require contracted PCPs and OB/GYNs to have the primary responsibility serving as the after-\nhours “on-call” telephone resource to members with medical problems. Providers should not routinely refer calls\nto an emergency room, unless the Medicaid member is experiencing a life-threatening health emergency.\nPlease Note: Providers are required to schedule appointments in accordance with appointment and availability\nstandards noted above to be determined compliant with access to care requirements when contacted by an\nMMC Plan member. Providers must not require a new patient to complete prerequisites to schedule an\nappointment, such as:\n• a copy of their medical record;\n• a health screening questionnaire; and/or\n• an immunization record.\nThe provider may request additional information from the new Medicaid member, if the appointment is scheduled\nat the time of the telephone request. The Department considers prerequisites to scheduling appointments as\nbarriers in gaining access to health care services. Medicaid PCPs are advised to contact the MMC Plan if they\nare having difficulty meeting the above appointment and availability standards.\nQuestions may be sent to the Office of Health Insurance Programs (OHIP), Division of Health Plan Contracting\nand Oversight, Bureau of Managed Care Certification and Surveillance at: BMCCSmail@health.ny.gov.",

New York State routinely completes surveillance activities to evaluate compliance with the following\nappointment availability standards, (Medicaid Model Contract 15.2, Appointment Availability Standards):\n• For urgent care: within twenty-four (24) hours of request.\n• Non-urgent “sick” visit: within forty-eight (48) to seventy-two (72) hours of request, as clinically indicated.\n• Routine non-urgent, preventive appointments except as otherwise provided in this Section: within four\n(4) weeks of request.\n• Initial prenatal visit: within three (3) weeks during first trimester, within two (2) weeks during the second\ntrimester and within one (1) week during the third trimester.\n• Adult baseline and routine physicals: within twelve (12) weeks from enrollment.\n• Well child care: within four (4) weeks of a request;\n• Initial family planning visits: within two (2) weeks of request.\n• Members must reach a live voice when calling a provider after-hours (i.e., an answering service).\nMMC Plans must require contracted PCPs and OB/GYNs to have the primary responsibility serving as the after-\nhours “on-call” telephone resource to members with medical problems. Providers should not routinely refer calls\nto an emergency room, unless the Medicaid member is experiencing a life-threatening health emergency.\nPlease Note: Providers are required to schedule appointments in accordance with appointment and availability\nstandards noted above to be determined compliant with access to care requirements when contacted by an\nMMC Plan member. Providers must not require a new patient to complete prerequisites to schedule an\nappointment, such as:\n• a copy of their medical record;\n• a health screening questionnaire; and/or\n• an immunization record.\nThe provider may request additional information from the new Medicaid member, if the appointment is scheduled\nat the time of the telephone request. The Department considers prerequisites to scheduling appointments as\nbarriers in gaining access to health care services. Medicaid PCPs are advised to contact the MMC Plan if they\nare having difficulty meeting the above appointment and availability standards.\nQuestions may be sent to the Office of Health Insurance Programs (OHIP), Division of Health Plan Contracting\nand Oversight, Bureau of Managed Care Certification and Surveillance at: BMCCSmail@health.ny.gov.",

It contains general information regarding New York State’s (NYS) transition\nstrategy and other important facts that will assist providers in transitioning members to the FFS Pharmacy\nProgram. Future Medicaid Update articles will provide additional details and guidance. More detailed\ninformation is available and regularly updated on the Pharmacy Carve-Out web page.\nGeneral Information\nEffective April 1, 2021, Medicaid members enrolled in mainstream Managed Care (MC) plans, Health and\nRecovery Plans (HARPs), and HIV-Special Needs Plan (SNPs) will receive their pharmacy benefits through\nthe Medicaid FFS Pharmacy Program instead of through their Medicaid MC plan as they do now. The\nPharmacy Carve-Out does not apply to members enrolled in Managed Long-Term Care plans (e.g., MLTC,\nPACE and MAP), the Essential Plan, or Child Health Plus (CHP). Transitioning the pharmacy benefit from\nMC to FFS will provide the State with full visibility into prescription drug costs, allow centralization of the\nbenefit, leverage negotiation power, and provide a single drug formulary with standardized utilization\nmanagement protocols simplifying and streamlining the drug benefit for Medicaid members.\nScope of Benefits\nThe FFS Pharmacy Carve-Out will not change the scope (e.g. copayments, covered drugs, etc.) of the\nexisting Medicaid Pharmacy benefit, which includes:\n• Covered outpatient prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs that are listed on the Medicaid\nPharmacy List of Reimbursable Drugs;\n• Pharmacist administered vaccines and supplies listed in the Pharmacy Procedures and Supply Codes\ndocument, such as enteral and parenteral nutrition, family planning, and medical/surgical supplies.\nThe complete list of items subject to the Pharmacy Benefit Carve-Out can be reviewed in the Carve-Out\nScope web page. Please Note: Physician administered (J-Code) drugs that are not listed on the Medicaid\nPharmacy List of Reimbursable Drugs and durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies\n(DMEPOS) as listed in sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7 of the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics and\nSupplies Manual are not subject to the carve-out.

The timing of medical home payments\nto Plans will remain at two times per year but will be based on SFY instead of CY. The following example will\nprovide guidance for transition into SFY calendar:\n• 2023 final CY payment: State pays health care plan July 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023.\n• 2024 transition into SFY: State pays health care plan January 1, 2024 through March 31, 2024, April\n1, 2024 through September 30, 2024, etc.\nAid Categories by Age\nChanges are coming regarding the way PCMH spend is categorized by aid category.

Providers who demonstrate\nMeaningful Use (MU) of their EHR systems are leading the way towards interoperability, which is the ability of\nhealthcare providers to exchange and use patient health records electronically. The ultimate goal is to increase\npatient involvement, reduce costs, and improve health outcomes.\nHow does using EHR promote interoperability?\n• Providers are ensuring that Protected Health Information (PHI) is private, secure, and easily useable by\nthe patient, their family, and by other providers - current and future;\n• There is full and easy access to all electronic health information that is authorized for such; and\n• There is protection against information blocking – when a provider, vendor, or information technology (IT)\ndeveloper knowingly and unreasonably interferes with the exchange and use of electronic health\ninformation. Examples of information blocking include: fees that make data exchange cost prohibitive;\norganizational policies that prohibit the exchange of information; or when patients or health care providers\nbecome “locked in” to a specific technology or health care network because data are not portable.\nImportant Note:\nAll EPs attesting to Payment Year (PY) 2019 Stage 3 MU must use 2015 Certified Electronic Health Record\nTechnology (CEHRT).\nRegister in MURPH: Stage 3 Objective 8 (Public Health)\nEPs must register their intent to submit data to the appropriate Public Health registries before or within 60 days\nfrom the start of their EHR Reporting Period. Providers who are using the EHR period starting January 1, 2019\nfor PY 2019 MU, must register by March 1st, 2019. EPs who previously registered with the Meaningful Use\nRegistration System for Public Health (MURPH) must use or update their existing MURPH registration rather\nthan start a new registration.\nFor questions please contact the New York Medicaid EHR Incentive Program Support Team at: 1-877-646-5410\n(option 3), or via email at: MUPublicHealthHelp@health.ny.gov\nNYS RECs\nNew York State (NYS) Regional Extension Centers (RECs) offer support to help providers meet their objectives.\nAnswers to questions regarding the program and requirements, assistance on selecting and using CEHRT, or\nhelp meeting program objectives is available? NYS RECs offer free assistance for all practices and providers\nlocated within New York.\nRECs were established nationwide to assist primary care providers in the adoption and meaningful use of EHRs.\nRECs work to optimize the use of EHRs so that providers can become meaningful users, engage in new health\ncare transformation and quality initiatives, and participate in payment delivery reform programs. NYS has two\nRECs that provide support services to healthcare providers as they navigate the EHR adoption process and\nachievement of MU.\nNYC REACH\nNew York City Regional Electronic Adoption Center for Health (NYC REACH) offers support services to providers\nlocated inside the five boroughs of New York City. NYC REACH supports and enhances the healthcare delivery\nsystem to improve population health by assisting New York City based independently-owned private practices,\ncommunity health centers, and hospital–based ambulatory sites with adopting and implementing health\nJanuary 2019 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 7\n\ninformation systems, quality improvement, and practice transformation initiatives.
