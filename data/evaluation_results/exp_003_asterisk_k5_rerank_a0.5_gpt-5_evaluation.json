To view the official PHE announcement, providers can\nrefer to the HHS “Public Health Emergency Declarations” web page at: https://www.phe.gov/\nemergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx. For more information on the federal PHE wind down,\nproviders can refer to the Unwinding and Returning to Regular Operations after COVID-19 web page, located\nat: https://www.medicaid.gov/resources-for-states/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/unwinding-and-retu\nrning-regular-operations-after-covid-19/index.html.\nAs NY prepares for the transition out of the PHE, the move to resume eligibility reviews could result in a large\nnumber of beneficiaries becoming disenrolled. The NYS Department of Health (DOH) is working with partners,\nlocal districts, and other stakeholders to inform consumers about renewing their coverage and exploring other\navailable health insurance options if they no longer qualify for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nDOH’s Strategy\nFederal guidance allows States 14 months to redetermine eligibility with 60 days advanced notice. In NY, this\nmeans renewing eligibility for 8.8 million people, including:\n• 1.4 million new enrollees who have never renewed coverage with DOH, and\n• 7.4 million who have not renewed their coverage in more than two years.\nAs part of this effort, DOH will update consumer notices and eligibility and enrollment systems. Consumers\nwill be sent renewal notices describing the action needed, if any, to renew their coverage. To manage the\nvolume, consumers will maintain their regular renewal “cycles” so that approximately one out of 12 of the\npopulation will renew each month. Additional details about this timeline will be delivered when HHS\nannounces the end date of the PHE.\nCommunications\nAdditionally, a public education campaign has been initiated by NY State of Health, the state’s official\nMarketplace. The campaign will:\n• prepare Medicaid, CHP and EP enrollees for the renewal process, communicate upcoming changes\nand encourage consumers to opt into NY State of Health text messages that will alert them when it is\ntime to renew their coverage (New Yorkers can sign up for text alerts by texting START to 1-866-988-\n0327);\n• remind consumers to update their contact information to ensure renewal information from the\nMarketplace reaches them; and\n• ensure consumers take the necessary steps to renew coverage and transition to other coverage if\nthey are no longer eligible for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nFor more information regarding NY State of Health’s communications prior to the end of the PHE, visit the NY\nState of Health Important Changes Are Coming to New York Medicaid, Child Health Plus and the Essential\nPlan web page, located at: https://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/COVID-19-Changes.\nJune 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 10\n\nHelp Us Spread the Word\nAn outreach toolkit, located on the NY State of Health “Unwinding from the COVID-19 Public Health\nEmergency: A Communications Tool Kit to Keep New Yorkers Covered” web page, at:\nhttps://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/PHE-tool-kit, is available to help prepare consumers for the changes\ncoming once the PHE ends.

This process is also referred to\nas the Public Health Emergency Unwind. States must conclude the entire Unwind process by December 31,\n2025, in accordance with recent guidance issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\nBeginning in mid-February 2025, the New York City (NYC) Human Resources Administration will include\nupdated language in its renewal packages informing NYS Medicaid members that their cases will be closed\nif the renewal packet is not returned by the due date. Renewal notices for NYS Medicaid members enrolled\nthrough a local social services district outside of NYC will include similar language indicating coverage will be\nclosed if the renewal packet is not returned by the due date. Please note: In some cases, a NYS Medicaid\nmember may be administratively renewed based on data sources. In that case, the NYS Medicaid member\nwill not receive a renewal packet but will instead receive a notice confirming a successful administrative\nrenewal.\nProviders can assist in this effort by informing their patients of this requirement and encouraging them to\ncomplete and return their renewal packet by the due date so their NYS Medicaid eligibility can be\nredetermined.",

In NY, this\nmeans renewing eligibility for 8.8 million people, including:\n• 1.4 million new enrollees who have never renewed coverage with DOH, and\n• 7.4 million who have not renewed their coverage in more than two years.\nAs part of this effort, DOH will update consumer notices and eligibility and enrollment systems. Consumers\nwill be sent renewal notices describing the action needed, if any, to renew their coverage.

Additional details about this timeline will be delivered when HHS\nannounces the end date of the PHE.\nCommunications\nAdditionally, a public education campaign has been initiated by NY State of Health, the state’s official\nMarketplace.

FQHCs That Have \"Opted Into\" APGs: FQHCs that have \"opted into\" APGs should follow the billing\nguidance outlined above for sites billing under APGs.\n2. FQHCs That Have Not \"Opted Into\" APGs - FQHC Originating Sites:\na. Consistent with Medicaid telehealth guidance issued in February 2019, when services are\nprovided via telemedicine to a patient located at an FQHC originating site, the originating site\nmay bill only the FQHC off-site services rate code (“4012”) to recoup administrative expenses\nassociated with the telemedicine encounter.\nb. When a separate and distinct medical service, unrelated to the telemedicine encounter, is\nprovided by a qualified practitioner at the FQHC originating site, the originating site may bill\nthe Prospective Payment System (PPS) rate in addition to the FQHC off-site services rate code\n(“4012”).\n3. FQHCs That Have Not \"Opted Into\" APGs – FQHC Distant Sites:\na. If a provider who is on-site at an FQHC or is providing service from the practitioner’s home\nduring the PHE via telemedicine to a member who is in their place of residence or other location\nincluding an originating site that is another provider’s office or clinic, the FQHC may bill the\nPPS rate and report the applicable modifier (“95” or “GT”) on the procedure code line.\n4. Wrap payments are available for any telehealth services, including telephonic services reimbursed by\nan MMC Plan, under qualifying PPS and off-site rate codes.\nD. Application-Specific Telehealth Billing Rules\nTelephonic (Audio-only)\nSee Section II: Telephonic Reimbursement Overview.\nStore-and-Forward Technology\n1. Reimbursement will be made to the consulting distant-site practitioner.\n2. The consulting distant-site practitioner must provide the requesting originating-site practitioner with a\nwritten report of the consultation in order for payment to be made.\n3. The consulting practitioner should bill the CPT code for the professional service appended with the\ntelehealth modifier \"GQ”.\nRemote Patient Monitoring (RPM)\n1. Telehealth services provided by means of RPM should be billed using CPT code \"99091\" [Collection\nand interpretation of physiologic data (e.g., Electrocardiography {ECG}, blood pressure, glucose\nmonitoring) digitally stored and/or transmitted by the patient and/or caregiver to the physician or other\nqualified health care professional, qualified by education, training and licensure/regulation (when\napplicable) requiring a minimum of 30 minutes of time].\n2. A fee of $48.00 per month will be paid for RPM.\n3. Providers are not to bill \"99091\" more than one time per member per month.\nJune 2021 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 11\n\nE. Medicaid Managed Care Considerations\n1. MMC Plans are required to cover, at a minimum, services that are covered by Medicaid FFS and also\nincluded in the MMC benefit package, when determined medically necessary and must provide\ntelehealth coverage as described in this guidance. MMC Plans may establish claiming requirements\n(e.g., specialized coding) that vary from FFS billing instructions in this guidance.\n2. Absent existing state mandated rates or negotiated rates for telehealth/telephonic services, MMC\nPlans must reimburse network providers at the same rate that would be reimbursed for providing the\nsame service via a face-to-face encounter.\n3. MMC Plans may not limit member access to telehealth/telephonic services to solely the MMC Plans\ntelehealth vendors and must cover appropriate telehealth/telephonic services provided by other\nnetwork providers.\n4. Questions regarding MMC reimbursement and/or documentation requirements should be directed to\nthe member's MMC Plan.\nVIII.

FQHCs That Have \"Opted Into\" APGs: FQHCs that have \"opted into\" APGs should follow the billing\nguidance outlined above for sites billing under APGs.\n2. FQHCs That Have Not \"Opted Into\" APGs - FQHC Originating Sites:\na. Consistent with Medicaid telehealth guidance issued in February 2019, when services are\nprovided via telemedicine to a patient located at an FQHC originating site, the originating site\nmay bill only the FQHC off-site services rate code (“4012”) to recoup administrative expenses\nassociated with the telemedicine encounter.\nb. When a separate and distinct medical service, unrelated to the telemedicine encounter, is\nprovided by a qualified practitioner at the FQHC originating site, the originating site may bill\nthe Prospective Payment System (PPS) rate in addition to the FQHC off-site services rate code\n(“4012”).\n3. FQHCs That Have Not \"Opted Into\" APGs – FQHC Distant Sites:\na. If a provider who is on-site at an FQHC or is providing service from the practitioner’s home\nduring the PHE via telemedicine to a member who is in their place of residence or other location\nincluding an originating site that is another provider’s office or clinic, the FQHC may bill the\nPPS rate and report the applicable modifier (“95” or “GT”) on the procedure code line.\n4. Wrap payments are available for any telehealth services, including telephonic services reimbursed by\nan MMC Plan, under qualifying PPS and off-site rate codes.\nD. Application-Specific Telehealth Billing Rules\nTelephonic (Audio-only)\nSee Section II: Telephonic Reimbursement Overview.\nStore-and-Forward Technology\n1. Reimbursement will be made to the consulting distant-site practitioner.\n2. The consulting distant-site practitioner must provide the requesting originating-site practitioner with a\nwritten report of the consultation in order for payment to be made.\n3. The consulting practitioner should bill the CPT code for the professional service appended with the\ntelehealth modifier \"GQ”.\nRemote Patient Monitoring (RPM)\n1. Telehealth services provided by means of RPM should be billed using CPT code \"99091\" [Collection\nand interpretation of physiologic data (e.g., Electrocardiography {ECG}, blood pressure, glucose\nmonitoring) digitally stored and/or transmitted by the patient and/or caregiver to the physician or other\nqualified health care professional, qualified by education, training and licensure/regulation (when\napplicable) requiring a minimum of 30 minutes of time].\n2. A fee of $48.00 per month will be paid for RPM.\n3. Providers are not to bill \"99091\" more than one time per member per month.\nJune 2021 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 11\n\nE. Medicaid Managed Care Considerations\n1. MMC Plans are required to cover, at a minimum, services that are covered by Medicaid FFS and also\nincluded in the MMC benefit package, when determined medically necessary and must provide\ntelehealth coverage as described in this guidance. MMC Plans may establish claiming requirements\n(e.g., specialized coding) that vary from FFS billing instructions in this guidance.\n2. Absent existing state mandated rates or negotiated rates for telehealth/telephonic services, MMC\nPlans must reimburse network providers at the same rate that would be reimbursed for providing the\nsame service via a face-to-face encounter.\n3. MMC Plans may not limit member access to telehealth/telephonic services to solely the MMC Plans\ntelehealth vendors and must cover appropriate telehealth/telephonic services provided by other\nnetwork providers.\n4. Questions regarding MMC reimbursement and/or documentation requirements should be directed to\nthe member's MMC Plan.\nVIII.

Pages four (4) through five (5) of the list of invited ambulance services contain the NYS invitees. The\nCMS ET3 Model aims to reduce expenditures and preserve or enhance quality of care by:\n• Providing person-centered care, such that beneficiaries receive the appropriate level of care\ndelivered safely at the right time and place while having greater control of their healthcare through the\navailability of more options.\n• Encouraging appropriate utilization of services to meet health care needs effectively.\n• Increasing efficiency in the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system to more readily respond\nto and focus on high-acuity emergency cases.\nCurrently, Medicare only pays for ground ambulance services when beneficiaries are transported to specific\ntypes of facilities. In an emergency setting, this is most often a hospital emergency department (ED), even\nwhen an alternative treatment option may be more appropriate. As part of the ET3 Model, CMS (and NYS\nMedicaid) will be testing two new ambulance payments. While continuing to pay for emergency\ntransportation of a Medicare beneficiary to a hospital ED, under the ET3 Model, Medicare will also pay\nparticipating ambulance suppliers and providers to:\n• Transport a beneficiary to an alternative destination (such as an urgent care clinic, federally qualified\nhealthcare center, hospital outpatient department, freestanding clinic or a physician’s office which over\ntime should include a priority to transport to the patient’s medical home/PCP as possible), or;\n• Initiate and facilitate treatment in place by a qualified health care practitioner, either in-person on the\nscene, or via telehealth. In this context, a qualified health care practitioner is limited to a physician,\nphysician’s assistant, nurse practitioner or, when appropriate for the patient, a licensed mental health\ncare professional.\nUpon arriving on the scene of a 911 call, participating ambulance suppliers and providers may triage\nbeneficiaries to one of the ET3 Model interventions. This requires the participating ambulance suppliers and\nproviders to partner with alternative destinations and with qualified health care practitioners to deliver\ntreatment in place (either on-the-scene or through telehealth). A patient can always choose to be brought to\nan ED if he or she prefers.\nAny ambulance supplier or provider approved to participate in the ET3 Model by CMS, may apply to NYS\nMedicaid for participation in a Medicaid parallel ET3 Model. The NYS Medicaid ET3 Model will mirror both\nthe timing and the tenets of the CMS ET3 Model.\n• The applicable base rate and mileage payment will be made for the transportation of a beneficiary to\nan alternative destination (such as an urgent care clinic, federally qualified healthcare center,\nhospital outpatient department, freestanding clinic or a physician’s office).\n• The applicable base rate payment will be made when an approved ambulance supplier or provider\ninitiates and facilitates treatment in place by a qualified health care practitioner, either in-person on\nthe scene, or via telehealth.\n• Payment to a qualified heath care practitioner or an alternative destination will be made separately,\nand in accordance with the appropriate NYS Medicaid fee schedule or plan negotiated payment.\nDecember 2020 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 6\n\nTo apply for participation in the NYS Medicaid ET3 Model, a CMS-approved ambulance supplier or\nprovider must submit:\n• Written confirmation of the CMS approval for its participation in the CMS ET3 Model.

In this context, a qualified health care practitioner is limited to a physician,\nphysician’s assistant, nurse practitioner or, when appropriate for the patient, a licensed mental health\ncare professional.\nUpon arriving on the scene of a 911 call, participating ambulance suppliers and providers may triage\nbeneficiaries to one of the ET3 Model interventions. This requires the participating ambulance suppliers and\nproviders to partner with alternative destinations and with qualified health care practitioners to deliver\ntreatment in place (either on-the-scene or through telehealth). A patient can always choose to be brought to\nan ED if he or she prefers.\nAny ambulance supplier or provider approved to participate in the ET3 Model by CMS, may apply to NYS\nMedicaid for participation in a Medicaid parallel ET3 Model. The NYS Medicaid ET3 Model will mirror both\nthe timing and the tenets of the CMS ET3 Model.\n• The applicable base rate and mileage payment will be made for the transportation of a beneficiary to\nan alternative destination (such as an urgent care clinic, federally qualified healthcare center,\nhospital outpatient department, freestanding clinic or a physician’s office).\n• The applicable base rate payment will be made when an approved ambulance supplier or provider\ninitiates and facilitates treatment in place by a qualified health care practitioner, either in-person on\nthe scene, or via telehealth.\n• Payment to a qualified heath care practitioner or an alternative destination will be made separately,\nand in accordance with the appropriate NYS Medicaid fee schedule or plan negotiated payment.\nDecember 2020 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 6\n\nTo apply for participation in the NYS Medicaid ET3 Model, a CMS-approved ambulance supplier or\nprovider must submit:\n• Written confirmation of the CMS approval for its participation in the CMS ET3 Model. Ambulance\nproviders or suppliers that have not been approved by CMS are ineligible for participation in\nNYS Medicaid ET3 Model.\n• A copy of the submitted CMS ET3 Model application and all supporting documents.\n• An affirmation, signed by the chief executive officer of the organization, agreeing to provide the NYS\nDepartment of Health (DOH) with copies of all quality improvement and other reports required by\nCMS.\n• Evidence of outreach to Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) in the region to coordinate\nnetwork and payment issues for both treat in place (including telehealth) and alternative\ndestinations.\nAll applications and any questions on the Medicaid component of the ET3 Model may be submitted\nelectronically to medtrans@health.ny.gov.",

The assigned PCP is also responsible for\nordering all non-emergency transportation, laboratory, durable medical equipment (DME), and pharmacy\nservices for the assigned restricted recipient. A referral will be needed from the assigned PCP for any non-\nemergency medical services when a specialist is required. Claims submitted for a restricted recipient will be\ndenied if information for the assigned PCP is not included on the claim as the referring provider.\nPharmacies filling prescriptions for a restricted recipient is required to coordinate with the assigned PCP to\nsafely manage the delivery of medications, including verifying referrals if prescriptions were not written by the\nassigned PCP. The pharmacy is responsible for using professional judgement in filling prescriptions without\nregard to restriction requirements if the prescriptions were written as part of an emergency department visit\nand the assigned PCP is unavailable (i.e., after hours) to verify the prescriptions. The pharmacy is responsible\nfor contacting the assigned PCP the next business day regarding the prescriptions obtained by the recipient.\nAn assigned primary inpatient hospital is responsible for providing all non-emergency inpatient services to the\nrestricted recipient except for services provided pursuant to an authorized referral.\nEmergency Pharmacy Situations\nIn the event of an emergency, such as drug shortages, unexpected pharmacy closures, and/or unexpected\ntravel, providers and pharmacies must refer to the instructions and contact information provided below.\nDuring normal business hours, the restricted recipient can obtain a temporary authorization to fill the\nprescription at an alternate pharmacy location by contacting:\n• the New York State (NYS) Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG)\nCall (518) 474-6866 or email omig.sm.rrp@omig.ny.gov (available Monday through Friday\nfrom 8 a.m. through 4 p.m.).\n• the local Department of Social Services (LDSS), if the restricted recipient received health coverage\nvia LDSS (Upstate residents).\nProviders and pharmacies should refer to the NYS Department of Health “Local Departments\nof Social Services (LDSS)” web page, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care\n/medicaid/ldss.htm.\n• the New York City (NYC) Human Resources Association (HRA), if the restricted recipient received\nhealth coverage via NYC HRA (NYC-residents).\nCall (888) 692-6116.\n• NY State of Health (NYSOH), if the restricted recipient obtained health coverage via NYSOH.\nCall (518) 457-0761 or email hxrestrict@health.ny.gov.\nDuring nights and weekends, the pharmacy can obtain a prior authorization (PA) by contacting the eMedNY\nCall Center by telephone at (800) 343-9000 (available Monday through Friday from 4 p.m. through 10 p.m.\nand Saturday and Sunday from 8:30 a.m. through 5:30 p.m.).\nJanuary 2025 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 7\n\nAdditional Information\nThe goal of the RRP is to coordinate medical services and improve quality of care for NYS Medicaid members.\nCoordination of care reduces the potential over-utilization of health care services and prevents abusive or\nfraudulent behavior. A restriction is implemented if it is found that a recipient has received duplicative,\nexcessive, contraindicated, or conflicting health care services, drugs, or supplies, or if a recipient commits\nfraudulent acts with their benefit card (i.e., forged prescriptions, card loaning, doctor shopping). The RRP may\nrestrict the recipient to care provided by a PCP, inpatient hospital, and/or primary pharmacy.\nAdditional information regarding the RRP can be found on the NYS OMIG “About the Recipient Restriction\nProgram (RRP)” web page, located at: https://omig.ny.gov/information-resources/about-recipient-restriction-\nprogram-rrp.",

A referral will be needed from the assigned PCP for any non-\nemergency medical services when a specialist is required. Claims submitted for a restricted recipient will be\ndenied if information for the assigned PCP is not included on the claim as the referring provider.\nPharmacies filling prescriptions for a restricted recipient is required to coordinate with the assigned PCP to\nsafely manage the delivery of medications, including verifying referrals if prescriptions were not written by the\nassigned PCP. The pharmacy is responsible for using professional judgement in filling prescriptions without\nregard to restriction requirements if the prescriptions were written as part of an emergency department visit\nand the assigned PCP is unavailable (i.e., after hours) to verify the prescriptions. The pharmacy is responsible\nfor contacting the assigned PCP the next business day regarding the prescriptions obtained by the recipient.\nAn assigned primary inpatient hospital is responsible for providing all non-emergency inpatient services to the\nrestricted recipient except for services provided pursuant to an authorized referral.\nEmergency Pharmacy Situations\nIn the event of an emergency, such as drug shortages, unexpected pharmacy closures, and/or unexpected\ntravel, providers and pharmacies must refer to the instructions and contact information provided below.\nDuring normal business hours, the restricted recipient can obtain a temporary authorization to fill the\nprescription at an alternate pharmacy location by contacting:\n• the New York State (NYS) Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG)\nCall (518) 474-6866 or email omig.sm.rrp@omig.ny.gov (available Monday through Friday\nfrom 8 a.m. through 4 p.m.).\n• the local Department of Social Services (LDSS), if the restricted recipient received health coverage\nvia LDSS (Upstate residents).\nProviders and pharmacies should refer to the NYS Department of Health “Local Departments\nof Social Services (LDSS)” web page, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care\n/medicaid/ldss.htm.\n• the New York City (NYC) Human Resources Association (HRA), if the restricted recipient received\nhealth coverage via NYC HRA (NYC-residents).\nCall (888) 692-6116.\n• NY State of Health (NYSOH), if the restricted recipient obtained health coverage via NYSOH.\nCall (518) 457-0761 or email hxrestrict@health.ny.gov.\nDuring nights and weekends, the pharmacy can obtain a prior authorization (PA) by contacting the eMedNY\nCall Center by telephone at (800) 343-9000 (available Monday through Friday from 4 p.m. through 10 p.m.\nand Saturday and Sunday from 8:30 a.m. through 5:30 p.m.).\nJanuary 2025 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 7\n\nAdditional Information\nThe goal of the RRP is to coordinate medical services and improve quality of care for NYS Medicaid members.\nCoordination of care reduces the potential over-utilization of health care services and prevents abusive or\nfraudulent behavior. A restriction is implemented if it is found that a recipient has received duplicative,\nexcessive, contraindicated, or conflicting health care services, drugs, or supplies, or if a recipient commits\nfraudulent acts with their benefit card (i.e., forged prescriptions, card loaning, doctor shopping). The RRP may\nrestrict the recipient to care provided by a PCP, inpatient hospital, and/or primary pharmacy.\nAdditional information regarding the RRP can be found on the NYS OMIG “About the Recipient Restriction\nProgram (RRP)” web page, located at: https://omig.ny.gov/information-resources/about-recipient-restriction-\nprogram-rrp.",
