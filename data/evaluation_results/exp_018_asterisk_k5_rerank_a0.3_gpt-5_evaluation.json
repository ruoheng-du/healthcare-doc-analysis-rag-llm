This process is also referred to\nas the Public Health Emergency Unwind. States must conclude the entire Unwind process by December 31,\n2025, in accordance with recent guidance issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\nBeginning in mid-February 2025, the New York City (NYC) Human Resources Administration will include\nupdated language in its renewal packages informing NYS Medicaid members that their cases will be closed\nif the renewal packet is not returned by the due date. Renewal notices for NYS Medicaid members enrolled\nthrough a local social services district outside of NYC will include similar language indicating coverage will be\nclosed if the renewal packet is not returned by the due date. Please note: In some cases, a NYS Medicaid\nmember may be administratively renewed based on data sources. In that case, the NYS Medicaid member\nwill not receive a renewal packet but will instead receive a notice confirming a successful administrative\nrenewal.\nProviders can assist in this effort by informing their patients of this requirement and encouraging them to\ncomplete and return their renewal packet by the due date so their NYS Medicaid eligibility can be\nredetermined.",

Throughout the COVID-19 PHE, NYS Medicaid\nproviders shifted traditional in person care to remote delivery, where possible. Although some barriers still\nexist and not all services are appropriate for remote delivery, telehealth has been largely beneficial in many\nservice areas. Remote services help address workforce shortages, access to specialists, infection control,\ntransportation issues, and dependent care challenges. In recognition of the changing landscape of healthcare\ndelivery and in preparation for the COVID-19 PHE unwind, the NYS Department of Health (DOH) sought\nfeedback from providers and NYS Medicaid members on their experience with telehealth to inform our post\nPHE policy.\nTo support the use of telehealth services, the NYS Medicaid program will continue to cover services delivered\nvia audio-visual telehealth, when appropriate, if such member chooses to receive telehealth services in lieu\nof an in-person visit. An audio-visual visit must contain all elements of the billable procedure codes or rate\ncodes and all required documentation.\nAudio-only services will also continue to be covered when audio-visual services are not available or when the\nmember chooses audio-only services in lieu of audio-visual telehealth or an in-person visit. Audio-only visits\nmust contain all elements of the billable procedure codes or rate codes and all required documentation.\nProviders must document in the chart of the NYS Medicaid member why audio-only services were used for\neach audio-only encounter.\nThis guidance does not change any other NYS Medicaid program requirements, with respect to authorized\nservices or provider enrollment, and does not expand authorization to bill NYS Medicaid beyond service\nproviders who are currently enrolled to bill Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) or contracted with a Medicaid\nManaged Care (MMC) Plan.",

Providers should not routinely refer calls\nto an emergency room, unless the Medicaid member is experiencing a life-threatening health emergency.\nPlease Note: Providers are required to schedule appointments in accordance with appointment and availability\nstandards noted above to be determined compliant with access to care requirements when contacted by an\nMMC Plan member. Providers must not require a new patient to complete prerequisites to schedule an\nappointment, such as:\n• a copy of their medical record;\n• a health screening questionnaire; and/or\n• an immunization record.\nThe provider may request additional information from the new Medicaid member, if the appointment is scheduled\nat the time of the telephone request. The Department considers prerequisites to scheduling appointments as\nbarriers in gaining access to health care services. Medicaid PCPs are advised to contact the MMC Plan if they\nare having difficulty meeting the above appointment and availability standards.\nQuestions may be sent to the Office of Health Insurance Programs (OHIP), Division of Health Plan Contracting\nand Oversight, Bureau of Managed Care Certification and Surveillance at: BMCCSmail@health.ny.gov.",

It contains general information regarding New York State’s (NYS) transition\nstrategy and other important facts that will assist providers in transitioning members to the FFS Pharmacy\nProgram. Future Medicaid Update articles will provide additional details and guidance. More detailed\ninformation is available and regularly updated on the Pharmacy Carve-Out web page.\nGeneral Information\nEffective April 1, 2021, Medicaid members enrolled in mainstream Managed Care (MC) plans, Health and\nRecovery Plans (HARPs), and HIV-Special Needs Plan (SNPs) will receive their pharmacy benefits through\nthe Medicaid FFS Pharmacy Program instead of through their Medicaid MC plan as they do now. The\nPharmacy Carve-Out does not apply to members enrolled in Managed Long-Term Care plans (e.g., MLTC,\nPACE and MAP), the Essential Plan, or Child Health Plus (CHP). Transitioning the pharmacy benefit from\nMC to FFS will provide the State with full visibility into prescription drug costs, allow centralization of the\nbenefit, leverage negotiation power, and provide a single drug formulary with standardized utilization\nmanagement protocols simplifying and streamlining the drug benefit for Medicaid members.\nScope of Benefits\nThe FFS Pharmacy Carve-Out will not change the scope (e.g. copayments, covered drugs, etc.) of the\nexisting Medicaid Pharmacy benefit, which includes:\n• Covered outpatient prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs that are listed on the Medicaid\nPharmacy List of Reimbursable Drugs;\n• Pharmacist administered vaccines and supplies listed in the Pharmacy Procedures and Supply Codes\ndocument, such as enteral and parenteral nutrition, family planning, and medical/surgical supplies.\nThe complete list of items subject to the Pharmacy Benefit Carve-Out can be reviewed in the Carve-Out\nScope web page. Please Note: Physician administered (J-Code) drugs that are not listed on the Medicaid\nPharmacy List of Reimbursable Drugs and durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies\n(DMEPOS) as listed in sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7 of the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics and\nSupplies Manual are not subject to the carve-out.

                    "text": "April 2023 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 7\n\nProper Billing for the Recipient Restriction Program\nThe Recipient Restriction Program (RRP) is a medical review and administrative mechanism whereby New\nYork State (NYS) Medicaid members with a demonstrated pattern of abusing or misusing NYS Medicaid\nservices may be restricted to a specific healthcare provider (i.e., hospital, clinic, physician) or pharmacy to\ncoordinate services. RRP is administered by the Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG) in\ncoordination with local Departments of Social Services (LDSS). The objectives of RRP include:\n• providing NYS Medicaid members with coordinated medical and pharmacy services, thus improving\nthe quality of their care;\n• reducing the inappropriate utilization of health care by identifying NYS Medicaid members exhibiting\nabusive or fraudulent behavior; and\n• utilizing Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) Plans and community providers to provide specific specialty\nand case management services. MMC Plans may add or modify restrictions only with the approval of\nOMIG.\nNYS Medicaid members who have been restricted as part of RRP to a designated health care provider\n(i.e., physician or clinic, hospital) or pharmacy are required to receive care only from the designated\nhealth care provider or pharmacy. A primary pharmacy is responsible for identifying the ordering prescriber\nand managing the delivery of medications.\nIt is important to remember that the primary health care provider, whether a physician, hospital, or clinic, is\nresponsible for the provision of most health care services for the restricted NYS Medicaid member. A referral\nwill be needed from these primary health care providers for any non-emergency medical services rendered\nby similar providers, including the ordering of transportation or prescriptions.\nWhen a restricted NYS Medicaid member is assigned to a designated provider and pharmacy, the provider\nand pharmacy will receive a letter informing them that the restricted NYS Medicaid member is restricted to\nthem. The letter also details the referral process. Additionally, the recipient is notified via the Notice of Intent\nto Restrict, which informs them of their restriction, their assigned providers, as well as their fair hearing\ninstructions.\nClaims submitted for a restricted NYS Medicaid member will be denied if the information of the\nprimary care provider is not included on the claim as the referring provider. Providers with questions\nregarding the submission of claims should contact eMedNY Provider Services at (800) 343-9000 or refer to\nthe provider manuals located on the eMedNY homepage, at: https://www.emedny.org/.\nBilling a Referral for a Restricted Recipient\nAs a result of the NYRx Pharmacy Benefit Transition, pharmacy services (outpatient prescriptions) for MMC\nenrollees are now being billed through NYRx, the NYS Medicaid Pharmacy Program, on a fee-for-service\n(FFS) basis. Medical claims for restricted MMC enrollees should follow guidelines established by the MMC\nPlan of the enrollee. Proper billing procedures for FFS recipients and the NYS Medicaid Pharmacy Program\nfor restricted recipients are explained below.\nApril 2023 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 8\n\nNYS Medicaid Claims\nFor NYS Medicaid claims, providers should refer to page 17 of the NYS Medicaid General Billing Guidelines\n– Professional, located at: https://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/AllProviders/General_Billing_Guide\nlines_Professional.pdf.
