To view the official PHE announcement, providers can\nrefer to the HHS “Public Health Emergency Declarations” web page at: https://www.phe.gov/\nemergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx. For more information on the federal PHE wind down,\nproviders can refer to the Unwinding and Returning to Regular Operations after COVID-19 web page, located\nat: https://www.medicaid.gov/resources-for-states/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/unwinding-and-retu\nrning-regular-operations-after-covid-19/index.html.\nAs NY prepares for the transition out of the PHE, the move to resume eligibility reviews could result in a large\nnumber of beneficiaries becoming disenrolled. The NYS Department of Health (DOH) is working with partners,\nlocal districts, and other stakeholders to inform consumers about renewing their coverage and exploring other\navailable health insurance options if they no longer qualify for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nDOH’s Strategy\nFederal guidance allows States 14 months to redetermine eligibility with 60 days advanced notice. In NY, this\nmeans renewing eligibility for 8.8 million people, including:\n• 1.4 million new enrollees who have never renewed coverage with DOH, and\n• 7.4 million who have not renewed their coverage in more than two years.\nAs part of this effort, DOH will update consumer notices and eligibility and enrollment systems. Consumers\nwill be sent renewal notices describing the action needed, if any, to renew their coverage. To manage the\nvolume, consumers will maintain their regular renewal “cycles” so that approximately one out of 12 of the\npopulation will renew each month. Additional details about this timeline will be delivered when HHS\nannounces the end date of the PHE.\nCommunications\nAdditionally, a public education campaign has been initiated by NY State of Health, the state’s official\nMarketplace. The campaign will:\n• prepare Medicaid, CHP and EP enrollees for the renewal process, communicate upcoming changes\nand encourage consumers to opt into NY State of Health text messages that will alert them when it is\ntime to renew their coverage (New Yorkers can sign up for text alerts by texting START to 1-866-988-\n0327);\n• remind consumers to update their contact information to ensure renewal information from the\nMarketplace reaches them; and\n• ensure consumers take the necessary steps to renew coverage and transition to other coverage if\nthey are no longer eligible for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nFor more information regarding NY State of Health’s communications prior to the end of the PHE, visit the NY\nState of Health Important Changes Are Coming to New York Medicaid, Child Health Plus and the Essential\nPlan web page, located at: https://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/COVID-19-Changes.\nJune 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 10\n\nHelp Us Spread the Word\nAn outreach toolkit, located on the NY State of Health “Unwinding from the COVID-19 Public Health\nEmergency: A Communications Tool Kit to Keep New Yorkers Covered” web page, at:\nhttps://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/PHE-tool-kit, is available to help prepare consumers for the changes\ncoming once the PHE ends. Providers can use these regularly updated resources to help communicate with\ntheir patients enrolled in Medicaid, CHP or EP about the important steps they need to take to maintain their\nhealth coverage.\nQuestions\nFor questions or feedback, providers should email pheunwind@health.ny.gov.\n",

It is imperative that members/enrollees are made aware of these\nchanges as they may risk losing their coverage if appropriate actions to renew are not made.\nBeginning in Spring 2023, renewal notices will be sent to members/enrollees based on their enrollment end\ndates. Renewal notices will include the deadline to take action to renew their insurance or risk having a gap\nin coverage. Deadlines will be based on the member/enrollee enrollment end dates and will range from June\n30, 2023, through May 31, 2024. During this time, NY State of Health, the Official Health Plan Marketplace\n(Marketplace), will keep enrollment open to allow consumers who are no longer eligible for Medicaid, CHP or\nEP to stay covered by enrolling in a Qualified Health Plan (QHP).\nContinued on Page 3\n",

Since inception of the PTPE process, the eMedNY “COVID\nFAQs” web page, located at: https://www.emedny.org/COVID19/FAQ/, has stated: “Within six months of the\nfederal public health emergency being lifted, New York State will cease payments to providers who are\ntemporarily enrolled unless a provider has submitted an application that meets all requirements for New York\nState Medicaid participation, and the application was reviewed and approved by the New York State\nDepartment of Health within six months of the federal public health emergency being lifted.”\nProviders who temporarily enrolled via the PTPE process must complete the full enrollment process by\nNovember 11, 2023, to continue participation in the program. Temporarily enrolled providers will be terminated\nand their NYS Medicaid payments will cease if they do not complete the enrollment process by November\n11, 2023. It can take up to 120 days to complete processing of an application; therefore, it is suggested that\napplications be submitted with enough time to ensure that they are processed by the November 11,\n2023 deadline.\nTo complete an application for full enrollment, providers should visit the eMedNY “Provider Enrollment &\nMaintenance” web page, located at: https://www.emedny.org/info/ProviderEnrollment/index.aspx. From\nthere, providers can navigate to the enrollment pages for their provider type where they will find instructions\nand a list of documents that must be submitted as part of a complete application.\nQuestions\nQuestions regarding the temporary-to-full enrollment process should be directed to providerenrollment\n@health.ny.gov.\n",

Throughout the COVID-19 PHE, NYS Medicaid\nproviders shifted traditional in person care to remote delivery, where possible. Although some barriers still\nexist and not all services are appropriate for remote delivery, telehealth has been largely beneficial in many\nservice areas. Remote services help address workforce shortages, access to specialists, infection control,\ntransportation issues, and dependent care challenges. In recognition of the changing landscape of healthcare\ndelivery and in preparation for the COVID-19 PHE unwind, the NYS Department of Health (DOH) sought\nfeedback from providers and NYS Medicaid members on their experience with telehealth to inform our post\nPHE policy.\nTo support the use of telehealth services, the NYS Medicaid program will continue to cover services delivered\nvia audio-visual telehealth, when appropriate, if such member chooses to receive telehealth services in lieu\nof an in-person visit. An audio-visual visit must contain all elements of the billable procedure codes or rate\ncodes and all required documentation.\nAudio-only services will also continue to be covered when audio-visual services are not available or when the\nmember chooses audio-only services in lieu of audio-visual telehealth or an in-person visit. Audio-only visits\nmust contain all elements of the billable procedure codes or rate codes and all required documentation.\nProviders must document in the chart of the NYS Medicaid member why audio-only services were used for\neach audio-only encounter.\nThis guidance does not change any other NYS Medicaid program requirements, with respect to authorized\nservices or provider enrollment, and does not expand authorization to bill NYS Medicaid beyond service\nproviders who are currently enrolled to bill Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) or contracted with a Medicaid\nManaged Care (MMC) Plan.\n",

FQHCs That Have \"Opted Into\" APGs: FQHCs that have \"opted into\" APGs should follow the billing\nguidance outlined above for sites billing under APGs.\n2. FQHCs That Have Not \"Opted Into\" APGs - FQHC Originating Sites:\na. Consistent with Medicaid telehealth guidance issued in February 2019, when services are\nprovided via telemedicine to a patient located at an FQHC originating site, the originating site\nmay bill only the FQHC off-site services rate code (“4012”) to recoup administrative expenses\nassociated with the telemedicine encounter.\nb. When a separate and distinct medical service, unrelated to the telemedicine encounter, is\nprovided by a qualified practitioner at the FQHC originating site, the originating site may bill\nthe Prospective Payment System (PPS) rate in addition to the FQHC off-site services rate code\n(“4012”).\n3. FQHCs That Have Not \"Opted Into\" APGs – FQHC Distant Sites:\na. If a provider who is on-site at an FQHC or is providing service from the practitioner’s home\nduring the PHE via telemedicine to a member who is in their place of residence or other location\nincluding an originating site that is another provider’s office or clinic, the FQHC may bill the\nPPS rate and report the applicable modifier (“95” or “GT”) on the procedure code line.\n4. Wrap payments are available for any telehealth services, including telephonic services reimbursed by\nan MMC Plan, under qualifying PPS and off-site rate codes.\nD. Application-Specific Telehealth Billing Rules\nTelephonic (Audio-only)\nSee Section II: Telephonic Reimbursement Overview.\nStore-and-Forward Technology\n1. Reimbursement will be made to the consulting distant-site practitioner.\n2. The consulting distant-site practitioner must provide the requesting originating-site practitioner with a\nwritten report of the consultation in order for payment to be made.\n3. The consulting practitioner should bill the CPT code for the professional service appended with the\ntelehealth modifier \"GQ”.\nRemote Patient Monitoring (RPM)\n1. Telehealth services provided by means of RPM should be billed using CPT code \"99091\" [Collection\nand interpretation of physiologic data (e.g., Electrocardiography {ECG}, blood pressure, glucose\nmonitoring) digitally stored and/or transmitted by the patient and/or caregiver to the physician or other\nqualified health care professional, qualified by education, training and licensure/regulation (when\napplicable) requiring a minimum of 30 minutes of time].\n2. A fee of $48.00 per month will be paid for RPM.\n3. Providers are not to bill \"99091\" more than one time per member per month.\nJune 2021 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 11\n\nE. Medicaid Managed Care Considerations\n1. MMC Plans are required to cover, at a minimum, services that are covered by Medicaid FFS and also\nincluded in the MMC benefit package, when determined medically necessary and must provide\ntelehealth coverage as described in this guidance. MMC Plans may establish claiming requirements\n(e.g., specialized coding) that vary from FFS billing instructions in this guidance.\n2. Absent existing state mandated rates or negotiated rates for telehealth/telephonic services, MMC\nPlans must reimburse network providers at the same rate that would be reimbursed for providing the\nsame service via a face-to-face encounter.\n3. MMC Plans may not limit member access to telehealth/telephonic services to solely the MMC Plans\ntelehealth vendors and must cover appropriate telehealth/telephonic services provided by other\nnetwork providers.\n4. Questions regarding MMC reimbursement and/or documentation requirements should be directed to\nthe member's MMC Plan.\nVIII.

Lanes 1 and 2 are for use by fee schedule billers (primarily practitioners in office-based settings). Lanes 3 through 6 are\nfor all other billers that primarily bill rates for clinic and other services. Practitioners that usually bill the fee schedule directly should bill for telephonic services\nusing Lanes 1 and 2 based on practitioner types noted. Clinics should bill using Lanes 3 through 5 depending on FQHC status and practitioner type. Lane\n5 is for clinics, non-licensed practitioners and FQHCs to use for the noted practitioners and should be used for any and all patient assessment and\nmanagement services that are appropriate to be billed telephonically unless otherwise noted. Lane 6 is reserved for all other services that do not fit into the\nfirst five lanes. More guidance will be issued on Lane 6 adding to the noted services, but it is expected that over 90 percent of all Medicaid telephonic billing\nshould fall into Lanes 1 through 5.\n\nIII. Telehealth\nA. Definition of Telehealth\nTelehealth is defined as the use of electronic information and communication technologies to deliver health\ncare to patients at a distance. Medicaid covered services provided via telehealth include assessment,\ndiagnosis, consultation, treatment, education, care management and/or self-management of a Medicaid\nmember. For purposes of the PHE, this definition is expanded to include audio-only conversations. Therefore,\nduring the PHE, telehealth includes telephonic, telemedicine, store and forward, and remote patient\nmonitoring. Telemedicine is the term used in this guidance to denote two-way audiovisual communication.\nDuring the PHE, all telehealth applications will be covered at all originating and distant sites as appropriate to\nproperly care for the patient.\nB. Originating Site\nThe originating site is where the member is located at the time health care services are delivered to him/her\nby means of telehealth. Originating sites during the PHE can be anywhere the member is located including\nthe member’s home. There are no limits on originating sites during the PHE.\nC. Distant Site\nThe distant site is the site where the telehealth provider is located while delivering health care services by\nmeans of telehealth. During the PHE, any site within the fifty United States (US) or US’ territories, is eligible\nto be a distant site for delivery and payment purposes, including FQHCs and providers’ homes, for all patients\nincluding patients dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare.\nD. Telemedicine\nTelemedicine uses two-way electronic audio-visual communications to deliver clinical health care services to\na patient at an originating site by a telehealth provider located at a distant site. Telemedicine includes\nteledentistry.\nE. Store-and-Forward Technology\nStore-and-forward technology involves the asynchronous, electronic transmission of a member's health\ninformation in the form of patient-specific pre-recorded videos and/or digital images from a provider at an\noriginating site to a telehealth provider at a distant site.\n1. Store-and-forward technology aids in diagnoses when live video or face-to-face contact is not readily\navailable or not necessary or in the case of the PHE is imprudent.\n2. Pre-recorded videos and/or static digital images (e.g., pictures), excluding radiology, must be specific\nto the member's condition as well as be adequate for rendering or confirming a diagnosis or a plan of\ntreatment.\nF. Remote Patient Monitoring\nRemote patient monitoring (RPM) uses digital technologies to collect medical data and other personal health\ninformation from members in one location and electronically transmit that information to health care providers\nin a different location for assessment and recommendations. Monitoring programs can collect a wide range\nof health data from the point of care, such as vital signs, blood pressure, heart rate, weight, blood sugar, blood\noxygen levels and electrocardiogram readings. RPM may include follow-up on previously transmitted data\nconducted through communication technologies or by telephone.\nMedical conditions that may be treated/monitored by means of RPM include, but are not limited to, congestive\nheart failure, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, wound care, polypharmacy, mental or\nbehavioral problems, and technology-dependent care such as continuous oxygen, ventilator care, total\nparenteral nutrition ",

NYS OMIG was also able to successfully overturn over three quarters of\nclaims originally determined to be in error utilizing records submitted by providers in response to\ndocumentation requests. Therefore, as with prior PERM reviews, although NYS OMIG will pursue appropriate\naction for payments determined to be in error, providers generally benefit from cooperating with requests for\ndocumentation.\n*For additional information regarding the national average error rate for medical reviews, providers can refer to the Department of\nHealth and Human Services – Agency Financial Report – Fiscal Year 2021, located at: https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2021-\nhhs-agency-financial-report.pdf.\nIf the submitted claim of a provider is selected for review, the CMS contractor and NYS OMIG will request\nwritten documentation to substantiate claims paid.

New York State routinely completes surveillance activities to evaluate compliance with the following\nappointment availability standards, (Medicaid Model Contract 15.2, Appointment Availability Standards):\n• For urgent care: within twenty-four (24) hours of request.\n• Non-urgent “sick” visit: within forty-eight (48) to seventy-two (72) hours of request, as clinically indicated.\n• Routine non-urgent, preventive appointments except as otherwise provided in this Section: within four\n(4) weeks of request.\n• Initial prenatal visit: within three (3) weeks during first trimester, within two (2) weeks during the second\ntrimester and within one (1) week during the third trimester.\n• Adult baseline and routine physicals: within twelve (12) weeks from enrollment.\n• Well child care: within four (4) weeks of a request;\n• Initial family planning visits: within two (2) weeks of request.\n• Members must reach a live voice when calling a provider after-hours (i.e., an answering service).\nMMC Plans must require contracted PCPs and OB/GYNs to have the primary responsibility serving as the after-\nhours “on-call” telephone resource to members with medical problems. Providers should not routinely refer calls\nto an emergency room, unless the Medicaid member is experiencing a life-threatening health emergency.\nPlease Note: Providers are required to schedule appointments in accordance with appointment and availability\nstandards noted above to be determined compliant with access to care requirements when contacted by an\nMMC Plan member. Providers must not require a new patient to complete prerequisites to schedule an\nappointment, such as:\n• a copy of their medical record;\n• a health screening questionnaire; and/or\n• an immunization record.\nThe provider may request additional information from the new Medicaid member, if the appointment is scheduled\nat the time of the telephone request. The Department considers prerequisites to scheduling appointments as\nbarriers in gaining access to health care services. Medicaid PCPs are advised to contact the MMC Plan if they\nare having difficulty meeting the above appointment and availability standards.\nQuestions may be sent to the Office of Health Insurance Programs (OHIP), Division of Health Plan Contracting\nand Oversight, Bureau of Managed Care Certification and Surveillance at: BMCCSmail@health.ny.gov.\n",

                    "text": "\nDecember 2020 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 5\n\nAttention Ambulance Services:\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\nEmergency Triage, Treat, and Transport (ET3) Model\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has invited twenty-five (25) New York State (NYS)\nambulance suppliers and providers to participate in its Emergency Triage, Treat, and Transport (ET3)\nModel. Pages four (4) through five (5) of the list of invited ambulance services contain the NYS invitees. The\nCMS ET3 Model aims to reduce expenditures and preserve or enhance quality of care by:\n• Providing person-centered care, such that beneficiaries receive the appropriate level of care\ndelivered safely at the right time and place while having greater control of their healthcare through the\navailability of more options.\n• Encouraging appropriate utilization of services to meet health care needs effectively.\n• Increasing efficiency in the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system to more readily respond\nto and focus on high-acuity emergency cases.\nCurrently, Medicare only pays for ground ambulance services when beneficiaries are transported to specific\ntypes of facilities. In an emergency setting, this is most often a hospital emergency department (ED), even\nwhen an alternative treatment option may be more appropriate. As part of the ET3 Model, CMS (and NYS\nMedicaid) will be testing two new ambulance payments. While continuing to pay for emergency\ntransportation of a Medicare beneficiary to a hospital ED, under the ET3 Model, Medicare will also pay\nparticipating ambulance suppliers and providers to:\n• Transport a beneficiary to an alternative destination (such as an urgent care clinic, federally qualified\nhealthcare center, hospital outpatient department, freestanding clinic or a physician’s office which over\ntime should include a priority to transport to the patient’s medical home/PCP as possible), or;\n• Initiate and facilitate treatment in place by a qualified health care practitioner, either in-person on the\nscene, or via telehealth. In this context, a qualified health care practitioner is limited to a physician,\nphysician’s assistant, nurse practitioner or, when appropriate for the patient, a licensed mental health\ncare professional.\nUpon arriving on the scene of a 911 call, participating ambulance suppliers and providers may triage\nbeneficiaries to one of the ET3 Model interventions. This requires the participating ambulance suppliers and\nproviders to partner with alternative destinations and with qualified health care practitioners to deliver\ntreatment in place (either on-the-scene or through telehealth). A patient can always choose to be brought to\nan ED if he or she prefers.\nAny ambulance supplier or provider approved to participate in the ET3 Model by CMS, may apply to NYS\nMedicaid for participation in a Medicaid parallel ET3 Model. The NYS Medicaid ET3 Model will mirror both\nthe timing and the tenets of the CMS ET3 Model.\n• The applicable base rate and mileage payment will be made for the transportation of a beneficiary to\nan alternative destination (such as an urgent care clinic, federally qualified healthcare center,\nhospital outpatient department, freestanding clinic or a physician’s office).\n• The applicable base rate payment will be made when an approved ambulance supplier or provider\ninitiates and facilitates treatment in place by a qualified health care practitioner, either in-person on\nthe scene, or via telehealth.\n• Payment to a qualified heath care practitioner or an alternative destination will be made separately,\nand in accordance with the appropriate NYS Medicaid fee schedule or plan negotiated payment.\nDecember 2020 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 6\n\nTo apply for participation in the NYS Medicaid ET3 Model, a CMS-approved ambulance supplier or\nprovider must submit:\n• Written confirmation of the CMS approval for its participation in the CMS ET3 Model. Ambulance\nproviders or suppliers that have not been approved by CMS are ineligible for participation in\nNYS Medicaid ET3 Model.\n• A copy of the submitted CMS ET3 Model application and all supporting documents.\n• An affirmation, signed by the chief executive officer of the organization, agreeing to provide the NYS\nDepartment of Health (DOH) with copies of all quality improvement and other reports required by\nCMS.\n• Evidence of outreach to Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) in the region to coordinate\nnetwork and payment issues for both treat in place (including telehealth) and alternative\ndestinations.\nAll applications and any questions on the Medicaid component of the ET3 Model may be submitted\nelectronically to medtrans@health.ny.gov.\n",

Treatment in place\nmust be provided by a licensed healthcare practitioner [physician, nurse practitioner (NP), or physician\nassistant (PA)], either in person or via telehealth. Non-hospital alternative destinations include Community\nMental Health Centers (CMHCs), substance use disorder treatment centers, Federally Qualified Health\nCenters (FQHCs), physician’s offices, and urgent care facilities. For more information about the ET3 Model\nin NYS Medicaid, providers can refer to the article titled The CMS Emergency Triage, Treat, and Transport\nModel with the Department of Health Parallel Model, published in the November 2021 issue of the Medicaid\nUpdate, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2021/docs/mu\n_no13_nov21_pr.pdf.\nNYS Department of Health (DOH) is pleased to announce that on February 16, 2022, NYS Medicaid\npaid its first ET3 ambulance claim for treatment in place. This service and payment model offers flexibility\nto ambulance providers to best address the care and needs of Medicaid members they treat, in response to\n911 calls. ET3 offers the ability to deliver the right care in the right environment and reduce ED overcrowding.\nThrough this model, NYS Medicaid promotes person-centered care by giving members more treatment\noptions as well as encouraging appropriate and efficient utilization of services that reduce strain on EMS\nsystems. All CMS ET3-approved ambulance providers are encouraged to participate in NYS Medicaid’s\nparallel model. A list of all CMS ET3 Model Selected Applicants, located at: https://innovation\n.cms.gov/files/x/et3-selected-applicants.pdf, is available and includes twenty-five NYS ambulance services.\nQuestions\nAll ET3-specific questions should be directed to the NYS DOH, Medical Transportation Unit by telephone at\n(518) 473-2160 or by email at MedTrans@health.ny.gov.\n",

This system upgrade offers an improved and more streamlined process\nfor providers interested in offering Medicaid services.\nPursuant to section 1135(b)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\nServices (CMS) has allowed states to temporarily waive and/or suspend some of the requirements for\nproviders who wish to temporarily enroll in fee-for-service (FFS) Medicaid for the purpose of assisting\nwith the COVID-19 public health emergency. As a result, and to expedite and simplify the enrollment\nprocess, the Department of Health’s Bureau of Provider Enrollment has taken action to implement\nthe following:\n(i) Create an online Provisional Temporary Provider Enrollment application process that\nallows physicians, registered physician assistants (RPAs), nurse practitioners (NPs),\nregistered nurses (RNs), and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) to enroll on a temporary basis\nfor the purpose of assisting with COVID-19 activities;\n(ii) Allow a retroactive effective date no earlier than March 1, 2020, for Provisional Temporary\nProvider Enrollments;\n(iii) Waive application fees for Provisional Temporary Provider Enrollment applications;\n(iv) Waive the screening requirements of site visits and fingerprint-based Criminal Background\nChecks for Provisional Temporary Provider Enrollments;\n(v) Allow providers who are enrolled in either Medicare or another state’s Medicaid program to\nenroll in NY Medicaid as Provisional Temporary providers;\n(vi) Allow providers who are licensed outside of New York State to render services to Medicaid\nmembers during the public health emergency as Provisional Temporary providers;\n(vii) Allow credentialing offices to submit multiple provider enrollments using a spreadsheet,\nprovided by eMedNY; and\n(viii) Enroll providers who are not enrolled in Medicare or another state’s Medicaid program if the\nrequested data is provided on the Provisional Temporary Provider Enrollment application and\nthe provider: 1) is not currently excluded from NYS Medicaid; 2) does not appear on the Office\nof Inspector General (OIG) Exclusions Database; and 3) is licensed and legally authorized to\npractice or deliver the service for which they file claims in at least one state or territory.\nContinued on page 3\n\nAndrew M.

In 2018, NYS DOH\ncollaborated with the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), creator of the PCMH program, to\ndevelop this exclusive transformation model for all eligible primary care providers in NYS. At that time, the\nAdvanced Primary Care (APC) Incentive Payment program ended to allow for the NYS implementation and\ntransition into the NYS PCMH model. Additional information regarding NYS PCMH can be found on the NCQA\n“New York State Patient-Centered Medical Home (NYS PCMH) Recognition Program” web page, located at:\nhttps://www.ncqa.org/programs/health-care-providers-practices/state-and-government-recognition/nys-\npatient-centered-medical-home/.\nProviders that achieve NYS PCMH recognition are eligible to receive payments provided in the form of either\nper member per month (PMPM) capitation payments for Medicaid Managed Care (MMC), including\nmainstream NYS Medicaid, Health and Recovery Plans (HARPs), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus-\nSpecial Needs Plans (HIV-SNPs), and Child Health Plus (CHPlus) members; or as a per-visit \"add-on\"\npayment for eligible claims billed for services provided to NYS Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) members.\nProviders should refer to Column A in the “NYS PCMH Payment” table below.\nNYS PCMH Managed Care Incentive\nRetroactive to April 1, 2024, primary care providers recognized under the NYS PCMH program are entitled to\nan incentive enhancement of $4.00/PMPM for MMC enrollees and CHPlus members under 21 years of age,\nand $2.00/PMPM for individuals 21 years of age and older, in addition to the current $6.00/PMPM payment.\nMMC Plans will be expected to calculate retroactive payments and furnish these payments to NYS PCMH-\nrecognized providers in their networks. In 2025, to receive this enhanced incentive payment (in addition to\nthe $6.00/PMPM), providers will be required to develop a workflow to refer patients to a Social Care Network\n(SCN) and submit an attestation by March 31, 2025, confirming their SCN participation. From April 1, 2024\nthrough March 31, 2025, all NYS PCMH providers will receive the incentive enhancement. Providers should\nrefer to Column B in the “NYS PCMH Payment” table below.\nEffective April 1, 2025, NYS PCMH providers that submit SCN attestation by March 31, 2025, will continue\nto receive the incentive enhancement. Providers should refer to Column C in the “NYS PCMH Payment” table\nbelow. NYS PCMH providers that do not attest to participation in an SCN will receive the $6.00/PMPM NYS\nPCMH payment without the incentive enhancement. Providers should refer to Column D in the “NYS PCMH\nPayment” table below.\nPCMH practices can submit attestations after the March 31, 2025 deadline and the PCMH practice will be\nincluded in the subsequent participation list for the additional $2.00 and $4.00 enhancement. PCMH practices\nthat submit attestations after March 31, 2025 will forfeit the $2.00 and $4.00 enhancement beginning April 1,\n2025 until the attestation is received. NYS DOH will release more details about the attestation form and\nprocess in the coming weeks. The attestation form will be available on the NYS Health Commerce System\n(HCS) website, located at: https://commerce.health.state.ny.us/.\nThe attestation will be completed once, per physical site location, covering all recognized providers at that\nlocation. In preparation, practices should check access to their NYS Health Commerce website accounts. A\nlink to the attestation form will be emailed to all NYS PCMH practices for completion using the NYS PCMH\ncontact email address(es) on file with NCQA.\nOctober 2024 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 10\n\nIn order for MMC, HARP, HIV SNP, and CHPlus plans to calculate PCMH incentive enhancement payment,\nthere will be an “SCN Indicator” on the monthly NYS PCMH file posted to the Health Commerce System that\nwill track provider completion of the attestation. Plans will calculate provider payment based on the information\ncorresponding to the “SCN Indicator”.\nSCNs have been established via the NYS DOH 1115 Waiver Amendment, “New York Health Equity Reform”\n(NYHER). NYS DOH recently announced contracts with regional entities, which will serve as lead entities for\nthe regional SCNs. SCNs are developing networks of community-based organizations to deliver social care\nservices to eligible NYS Medicaid members.

This expansion, approved on March 24, 2022 by the Centers\nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in State Plan Amendment (SPA) #21-0026, includes sickle cell\ndisease (SCD) as a single qualifying condition for Health Homes Serving Adults (HHSA) and Health Homes\nServing Children (HHSC). Please note: Medicaid State Plan Amendment (#21–0026) can be accessed via\nthe NYS DOH “Medicaid Health Homes - State Plan Amendments” web page, located at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/medicaid_health_homes/med_spa.htm.\nIndividuals enrolled in the NYS Medicaid Health Home program must also meet appropriateness criteria,\nwhich includes significant behavioral, medical, or social risk factors requiring intensive care management\nservices, and have:\n• two or more chronic conditions, or\n• one single qualifying condition, such as:\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or\nserious mental illness (SMI) (adults), or\nserious emotional disturbances (SED), or\ncomplex trauma (children), or\nnew: SCD.\nThe inclusion of SCD as a single qualifying condition recognizes the unique challenges in access to services\nfaced by individuals with SCD, their families and/or supports. One key focus is to ensure effective transition\nof young adults with SCD from pediatric to adult care. These individuals often face difficulty accessing\nservices, including finding adult specialists who accept patients with SCD, who understand SCD, and who\nacknowledge the patient’s readiness for self-management. Additional challenges include:\n• managing the comorbidities associated with SCD,\n• understanding pain and pain control/management issues,\n• recognizing self-care and self-efficacy,\n• acknowledging and addressing social determinants of health,\n• connecting to community support services (such as peer supports) and appropriate educational\ninformation.\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• Questions should be directed to the Health Home program at healthhomes@health.ny.gov.\n• For information regarding the implementation of the NYS Medicaid Health Home program, providers\ncan refer to the April 2012 Special Edition Medicaid Update titled Introducing Health Homes Improving\nCare for Medicaid Recipients with Chronic Conditions, available at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2012/april12muspec.pdf.\n",

It is best practice for primary care providers to document their referral\nworkflow and attestation survey response, for their own records.\nThe NYS PCMH incentive enhancement will be paid in addition to the current $6.00/PMPM payment.\nAdditionally, NYS Medicaid health plans, Health and Recovery Plans, Human Immunodeficiency Virus-\nSpecial Needs Plans, and CHPlus Plans will be instructed to calculate and pay the NYS PCMH incentive\nenhancement. Practices submitting attestations after April 1, 2025, will forfeit monthly incentive enhancement\npayments until the attestation is received. Practices will continue to receive the current $6.00/PMPM.\nPractice(s) must complete the NYS Department of Health (DOH) password protected attestation, located at:\nhttps://smartforms.health.ny.gov/public?formId=675a009d3aad5089bec295b0.

                    "text": "\nApril 2023 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 7\n\nProper Billing for the Recipient Restriction Program\nThe Recipient Restriction Program (RRP) is a medical review and administrative mechanism whereby New\nYork State (NYS) Medicaid members with a demonstrated pattern of abusing or misusing NYS Medicaid\nservices may be restricted to a specific healthcare provider (i.e., hospital, clinic, physician) or pharmacy to\ncoordinate services. RRP is administered by the Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG) in\ncoordination with local Departments of Social Services (LDSS). The objectives of RRP include:\n• providing NYS Medicaid members with coordinated medical and pharmacy services, thus improving\nthe quality of their care;\n• reducing the inappropriate utilization of health care by identifying NYS Medicaid members exhibiting\nabusive or fraudulent behavior; and\n• utilizing Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) Plans and community providers to provide specific specialty\nand case management services. MMC Plans may add or modify restrictions only with the approval of\nOMIG.\nNYS Medicaid members who have been restricted as part of RRP to a designated health care provider\n(i.e., physician or clinic, hospital) or pharmacy are required to receive care only from the designated\nhealth care provider or pharmacy. A primary pharmacy is responsible for identifying the ordering prescriber\nand managing the delivery of medications.\nIt is important to remember that the primary health care provider, whether a physician, hospital, or clinic, is\nresponsible for the provision of most health care services for the restricted NYS Medicaid member. A referral\nwill be needed from these primary health care providers for any non-emergency medical services rendered\nby similar providers, including the ordering of transportation or prescriptions.\nWhen a restricted NYS Medicaid member is assigned to a designated provider and pharmacy, the provider\nand pharmacy will receive a letter informing them that the restricted NYS Medicaid member is restricted to\nthem. The letter also details the referral process. Additionally, the recipient is notified via the Notice of Intent\nto Restrict, which informs them of their restriction, their assigned providers, as well as their fair hearing\ninstructions.\nClaims submitted for a restricted NYS Medicaid member will be denied if the information of the\nprimary care provider is not included on the claim as the referring provider. Providers with questions\nregarding the submission of claims should contact eMedNY Provider Services at (800) 343-9000 or refer to\nthe provider manuals located on the eMedNY homepage, at: https://www.emedny.org/.\nBilling a Referral for a Restricted Recipient\nAs a result of the NYRx Pharmacy Benefit Transition, pharmacy services (outpatient prescriptions) for MMC\nenrollees are now being billed through NYRx, the NYS Medicaid Pharmacy Program, on a fee-for-service\n(FFS) basis. Medical claims for restricted MMC enrollees should follow guidelines established by the MMC\nPlan of the enrollee. Proper billing procedures for FFS recipients and the NYS Medicaid Pharmacy Program\nfor restricted recipients are explained below.\nApril 2023 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 8\n\nNYS Medicaid Claims\nFor NYS Medicaid claims, providers should refer to page 17 of the NYS Medicaid General Billing Guidelines\n– Professional, located at: https://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/AllProviders/General_Billing_Guide\nlines_Professional.pdf. Per the New York State Medicaid Companion Guide V 4.0, located at:\nhttps://www.emedny.org/HIPAA/5010/transactions/eMedNY_Transaction_Information_CAQH-CORE_CG_X\n12_version_5010.pdf, “when providing services to a member who is restricted to a primary physician or facility,\nthe National Provider Identifier (NPI) of the referring professional must be entered.

As a result, a restricted recipient will be required to obtain all their care, directly or by referral, from\ntheir assigned providers.\nAn assigned primary care provider (PCP) is responsible for providing direct medical care or coordinating care\nthrough referral to another medical provider for specialty services. The assigned PCP is also responsible for\nordering all non-emergency transportation, laboratory, durable medical equipment (DME), and pharmacy\nservices for the assigned restricted recipient. A referral will be needed from the assigned PCP for any non-\nemergency medical services when a specialist is required. Claims submitted for a restricted recipient will be\ndenied if information for the assigned PCP is not included on the claim as the referring provider.\nPharmacies filling prescriptions for a restricted recipient is required to coordinate with the assigned PCP to\nsafely manage the delivery of medications, including verifying referrals if prescriptions were not written by the\nassigned PCP. The pharmacy is responsible for using professional judgement in filling prescriptions without\nregard to restriction requirements if the prescriptions were written as part of an emergency department visit\nand the assigned PCP is unavailable (i.e., after hours) to verify the prescriptions. The pharmacy is responsible\nfor contacting the assigned PCP the next business day regarding the prescriptions obtained by the recipient.\nAn assigned primary inpatient hospital is responsible for providing all non-emergency inpatient services to the\nrestricted recipient except for services provided pursuant to an authorized referral.\nEmergency Pharmacy Situations\nIn the event of an emergency, such as drug shortages, unexpected pharmacy closures, and/or unexpected\ntravel, providers and pharmacies must refer to the instructions and contact information provided below.\nDuring normal business hours, the restricted recipient can obtain a temporary authorization to fill the\nprescription at an alternate pharmacy location by contacting:\n• the New York State (NYS) Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG)\nCall (518) 474-6866 or email omig.sm.rrp@omig.ny.gov (available Monday through Friday\nfrom 8 a.m. through 4 p.m.).\n• the local Department of Social Services (LDSS), if the restricted recipient received health coverage\nvia LDSS (Upstate residents).\nProviders and pharmacies should refer to the NYS Department of Health “Local Departments\nof Social Services (LDSS)” web page, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care\n/medicaid/ldss.htm.\n• the New York City (NYC) Human Resources Association (HRA), if the restricted recipient received\nhealth coverage via NYC HRA (NYC-residents).\nCall (888) 692-6116.\n• NY State of Health (NYSOH), if the restricted recipient obtained health coverage via NYSOH.\nCall (518) 457-0761 or email hxrestrict@health.ny.gov.\nDuring nights and weekends, the pharmacy can obtain a prior authorization (PA) by contacting the eMedNY\nCall Center by telephone at (800) 343-9000 (available Monday through Friday from 4 p.m. through 10 p.m.\nand Saturday and Sunday from 8:30 a.m. through 5:30 p.m.).\nJanuary 2025 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 7\n\nAdditional Information\nThe goal of the RRP is to coordinate medical services and improve quality of care for NYS Medicaid members.\nCoordination of care reduces the potential over-utilization of health care services and prevents abusive or\nfraudulent behavior. A restriction is implemented if it is found that a recipient has received duplicative,\nexcessive, contraindicated, or conflicting health care services, drugs, or supplies, or if a recipient commits\nfraudulent acts with their benefit card (i.e., forged prescriptions, card loaning, doctor shopping).

VFCAs are no longer the payor for services provided to this population; providers will\nbe reimbursed directly by Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) or the child’s/youth’s MMC Plan.\nMMC Plans have already established, and will continue to offer, contracts with community providers with\nexpertise in working with and treating the foster care population. Pharmacies and other providers serving this\npopulation are strongly encouraged to enroll in the NYS Medicaid program and engage with MMC Plans in\ntheir area to ensure continued coverage for their patients. LDSS are reminded of the critical importance to\nverify and/or establish Medicaid immediately upon a child/youth entry into foster care to prevent potential\ndelays in coverage and/or payment below:\n• Medicaid coverage for an eligible child/youth will be retroactive to the beginning of the month in which\nthe child/youth enters foster care.\n• Enrollment in the child’s/youth’s selected MMC Plan will be retroactive to the beginning of the month\nin which the Medicaid case was established.\nDecember 2021 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 4\n\nUpon establishment of Medicaid coverage and issuance of a Medicaid Client Identification Number (CIN),\nclaims for services provided during this retroactive coverage period can be billed to the child/youth MMC Plan\nfor the period during which plan coverage applies, or to eMedNY for the FFS coverage period. Providers are\nencouraged to work collaboratively with the LDSS and the VFCA if there is a service need prior to the CIN\nbeing issued and are reminded to honor letters of coverage, as instances may arise where children/youth\nrequire immediate and medically necessary services prior to receiving identification (ID) cards.\nNYS has recently amended the utilization review guidelines to extend the prohibition on utilization reviews\nfrom no earlier than 180 days from the child/youth enrollment in the MMC Plan to no earlier than April 1, 2022\nor no earlier than 180 days from the child/youth enrollment in the MMC Plan, whichever is later.

Providers who demonstrate\nMeaningful Use (MU) of their EHR systems are leading the way towards interoperability, which is the ability of\nhealthcare providers to exchange and use patient health records electronically. The ultimate goal is to increase\npatient involvement, reduce costs, and improve health outcomes.\nHow does using EHR promote interoperability?\n• Providers are ensuring that Protected Health Information (PHI) is private, secure, and easily useable by\nthe patient, their family, and by other providers - current and future;\n• There is full and easy access to all electronic health information that is authorized for such; and\n• There is protection against information blocking – when a provider, vendor, or information technology (IT)\ndeveloper knowingly and unreasonably interferes with the exchange and use of electronic health\ninformation. Examples of information blocking include: fees that make data exchange cost prohibitive;\norganizational policies that prohibit the exchange of information; or when patients or health care providers\nbecome “locked in” to a specific technology or health care network because data are not portable.\nImportant Note:\nAll EPs attesting to Payment Year (PY) 2019 Stage 3 MU must use 2015 Certified Electronic Health Record\nTechnology (CEHRT).\nRegister in MURPH: Stage 3 Objective 8 (Public Health)\nEPs must register their intent to submit data to the appropriate Public Health registries before or within 60 days\nfrom the start of their EHR Reporting Period. Providers who are using the EHR period starting January 1, 2019\nfor PY 2019 MU, must register by March 1st, 2019. EPs who previously registered with the Meaningful Use\nRegistration System for Public Health (MURPH) must use or update their existing MURPH registration rather\nthan start a new registration.\nFor questions please contact the New York Medicaid EHR Incentive Program Support Team at: 1-877-646-5410\n(option 3), or via email at: MUPublicHealthHelp@health.ny.gov\nNYS RECs\nNew York State (NYS) Regional Extension Centers (RECs) offer support to help providers meet their objectives.\nAnswers to questions regarding the program and requirements, assistance on selecting and using CEHRT, or\nhelp meeting program objectives is available?
