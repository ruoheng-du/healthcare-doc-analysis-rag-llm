As a result, and to expedite and simplify the enrollment\nprocess, the Department of Health’s Bureau of Provider Enrollment has taken action to implement\nthe following:\n(i) Create an online Provisional Temporary Provider Enrollment application process that\nallows physicians, registered physician assistants (RPAs), nurse practitioners (NPs),\nregistered nurses (RNs), and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) to enroll on a temporary basis\nfor the purpose of assisting with COVID-19 activities;\n(ii) Allow a retroactive effective date no earlier than March 1, 2020, for Provisional Temporary\nProvider Enrollments;\n(iii) Waive application fees for Provisional Temporary Provider Enrollment applications;\n(iv) Waive the screening requirements of site visits and fingerprint-based Criminal Background\nChecks for Provisional Temporary Provider Enrollments;\n(v) Allow providers who are enrolled in either Medicare or another state’s Medicaid program to\nenroll in NY Medicaid as Provisional Temporary providers;\n(vi) Allow providers who are licensed outside of New York State to render services to Medicaid\nmembers during the public health emergency as Provisional Temporary providers;\n(vii) Allow credentialing offices to submit multiple pr",

The availability of affordable\ncoverage through the Marketplace and the ARPA enhanced tax credits is crucial.\nMarch 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 12\n\nIn March 2022, NY State of Health released data found in the By the Numbers – Health Insurance Coverage\nUpdate document, located at: https://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/sites/default/files/Health%20Insurance%20\nCoverage%20Update%20by%20Congressional%20District%20-%20March%202022.pdf, showing that New\nYorkers who receive enhanced ARPA tax credit savings have greatly benefitted. However, without the\nenhanced tax credit savings and when the PHE ends, individuals who transition from Medicaid and Essential\nPlan – without a monthly premium – to a Qualified Health Plan (QHP) through the Marketplace, may find\ncoverage too expensive, leading to significant increases in uninsured New Yorkers. Under ARPA, New\nYorkers have been receiving enhanced tax credit savings since 2021 that have saved consumers an average\nof $100 per month on QHP premium costs in 2021, making premiums the lowest they have been in years.

Temporarily enrolled providers will be terminated\nand their NYS Medicaid payments will cease if they do not complete the enrollment process by November\n11, 2023.

This service and payment model offers flexibility\nto ambulance providers to best address the care and needs of Medicaid members they treat, in response to\n911 calls. ET3 offers the ability to deliver the right care in the right environment and reduce ED overcrowding.\nThrough this model, NYS Medicaid promotes person-centered care by giving members more treatment\noptions as well as encouraging appropriate and efficient utilization of services that reduce strain on EMS\nsystems. All CMS ET3-approved ambulance providers are encouraged to participate in NYS Medicaid’s\nparallel model. A list of all CMS ET3 Model Selected Applicants, located at: https://innovation\n.cms.gov/files/x/et3-selected-applicants.pdf, is available and includes twenty-five NYS ambulance services.\nQuestions\nAll ET3-specific questions should be directed to the NYS DOH, Medical Transportation Unit by telephone at\n(518) 473-2160 or by email at MedTrans@health.ny.gov.\n***************************************************************************************************************\nNY State of Health: Affordable Care Act 12th Anniversary; Congress\nEncouragement to Extend American Rescue Plan Tax Credits;\nMedicaid Resumes Eligibility Reviews, Disenrolled Members Should\nBe Directed to the Marketplace\nAs the Affordable Care Act advances into its 12th year since implementation, NY State of Health, Official\nHealth Plan Marketplace (Marketplace), is reporting record-breaking enrollment numbers.

It contains general information regarding New York State’s (NYS) transition\nstrategy and other important facts that will assist providers in transitioning members to the FFS Pharmacy\nProgram. Future Medicaid Update articles will provide additional details and guidance. More detailed\ninformation is available and regularly updated on the Pharmacy Carve-Out web page.\nGeneral Information\nEffective April 1, 2021, Medicaid members enrolled in mainstream Managed Care (MC) plans, Health and\nRecovery Plans (HARPs), and HIV-Special Needs Plan (SNPs) will receive their pharmacy benefits through\nthe Medicaid FFS Pharmacy Program instead of through their Medicaid MC plan as they do now. The\nPharmacy Carve-Out does not apply to members enrolled in Managed Long-Term Care plans (e.g., MLTC,\nPACE and MAP), the Essential Plan, or Child Health Plus (CHP). Transitioning the pharmacy benefit from\nMC to FFS will provide the State with full visibility into prescription drug costs, allow centralization of the\nbenefit, leverage negotiation power, and provide a single drug formulary with standardized utilization\nmanagement protocols simplifying and streamlining the drug benefit for Medicaid members.\nScope of Benefits\nThe FFS Pharmacy Carve-Out will not change the scope (e.g. copayments, covered drugs, etc.) of the\nexisting Medicaid Pharmacy benefit, which includes:\n• Covered outpatient prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs that are listed on the Medicaid\nPharmacy List of Reimbursable Drugs;\n• Pharmacist administered vaccines and supplies listed in the Pharmacy Procedures and Supply Codes\ndocument, such as enteral and parenteral nutrition, family planning, and medi",

HHCM services are not subject to\nRRP limitations and must be paid by FFS and MMC providers regardless of the RRP status of the NYS\nMedicaid member.\nThe RRP is managed by the NYS Office of Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG). The purpose of the RRP is\nto coordinate medical services and improve quality of care for NYS Medicaid members. Coordination of care\nreduces the potential over-utilization of health care services and prevents abusive or fraudulent behavior. A\nrestriction is implemented if it is found that a pattern of duplicative, excessive, contraindicated, and/or\nconflicting health care services, medications, and/or supplies, have been received by the NYS Medicaid\nmember, and/or if a NYS Medicaid member commits fraudulent acts with their benefit card (i.e., forged\nprescriptions, card loaning, doctor shopping). The RRP may restrict the NYS Medicaid member to care\nprovided or referred by a primary care provider (PCP), inpatient hospital, and/or primary pharmacy. The\ndesignated primary physician or primary clinic is responsible for providing all non-emergent medical care to\nrestricted NYS Medicaid members, either directly or by referring them to another medical provider for\nappropriate services.\nHH care managers should familiarize themselves with NYS Medicaid members",

The objectives of RRP include:\n• providing NYS Medicaid members with coordinated medical and pharmacy services, thus improving\nthe quality of their care;\n• reducing the inappropriate utilization of health care by identifying NYS Medicaid members exhibiting\nabusive or fraudulent behavior; and\n• utilizing Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) Plans and community providers to provide specific specialty\nand case management services. MMC Plans may add or modify restrictions only with the approval of\nOMIG.\nNYS Medicaid members who have been restricted as part of RRP to a designated health care provider\n(i.e., physician or clinic, hospital) or pharmacy are required to receive care only from the designated\nhealth care provider or pharmacy. A primary pharmacy is responsible for identifying the ordering prescriber\nand managing the delivery of medications.\nIt is important to remember that the primary health care provider, whether a physician, hospital, or clinic, is\nresponsible for the provision of most health care services for the restricted NYS Medicaid member. A referral\nwill be needed from these primary health care providers for any non-emergency medical services rendered\nby similar providers, including the ordering of transportation or prescriptions.\nWhen a restricted NYS Medicaid member i",
