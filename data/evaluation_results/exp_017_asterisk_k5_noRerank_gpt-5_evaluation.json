To view the official PHE announcement, providers can\nrefer to the HHS “Public Health Emergency Declarations” web page at: https://www.phe.gov/\nemergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx. For more information on the federal PHE wind down,\nproviders can refer to the Unwinding and Returning to Regular Operations after COVID-19 web page, located\nat: https://www.medicaid.gov/resources-for-states/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/unwinding-and-retu\nrning-regular-operations-after-covid-19/index.html.\nAs NY prepares for the transition out of the PHE, the move to resume eligibility reviews could result in a large\nnumber of beneficiaries becoming disenrolled. The NYS Department of Health (DOH) is working with partners,\nlocal districts, and other stakeholders to inform consumers about renewing their coverage and exploring other\navailable health insurance options if they no longer qualify for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nDOH’s Strategy\nFederal guidance allows States 14 months to redetermine eligibility with 60 days advanced notice. In NY, this\nmeans renewing eligibility for 8.8 million people, including:\n• 1.4 million new enrollees who have never renewed coverage with DOH, and\n• 7.4 million who have not renewed their coverage in more than two years.\nAs part of this effort, DOH will update consumer notices and eligibility and enrollment systems. Consumers\nwill be sent renewal notices describing the action needed, if any, to renew their coverage. To manage the\nvolume, consumers will maintain their regular renewal “cycles” so that approximately one out of 12 of the\npopulation will renew each month. Additional details about this timeline will be delivered when HHS\nannounces the end date of the PHE.\nCommunications\nAdditionally, a public education campaign has been initiated by NY State of Health, the state’s official\nMarketplace. The campaign will:\n• prepare Medicaid, CHP and EP enrollees for the renewal process, communicate upcoming changes\nand encourage consumers to opt into NY State of Health text messages that will alert them when it is\ntime to renew their coverage (New Yorkers can sign up for text alerts by texting START to 1-866-988-\n0327);\n• remind consumers to update their contact information to ensure renewal information from the\nMarketplace reaches them; and\n• ensure consumers take the necessary steps to renew coverage and transition to other coverage if\nthey are no longer eligible for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nFor more information regarding NY State of Health’s communications prior to the end of the PHE, visit the NY\nState of Health Important Changes Are Coming to New York Medicaid, Child Health Plus and the Essential\nPlan web page, located at: https://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/COVID-19-Changes.\nJune 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 10\n\nHelp Us Spread the Word\nAn outreach toolkit, located on the NY State of Health “Unwinding from the COVID-19 Public Health\nEmergency: A Communications Tool Kit to Keep New Yorkers Covered” web page, at:\nhttps://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/PHE-tool-kit, is available to help prepare consumers for the changes\ncoming once the PHE ends. Providers can use these regularly updated resources to help communicate with\ntheir patients enrolled in Medicaid, CHP or EP about the important steps they need to take to maintain their\nhealth coverage.\nQuestions\nFor questions or feedback, providers should email pheunwind@health.ny.gov.\n",

Throughout the COVID-19 PHE, NYS Medicaid\nproviders shifted traditional in person care to remote delivery, where possible. Although some barriers still\nexist and not all services are appropriate for remote delivery, telehealth has been largely beneficial in many\nservice areas. Remote services help address workforce shortages, access to specialists, infection control,\ntransportation issues, and dependent care challenges. In recognition of the changing landscape of healthcare\ndelivery and in preparation for the COVID-19 PHE unwind, the NYS Department of Health (DOH) sought\nfeedback from providers and NYS Medicaid members on their experience with telehealth to inform our post\nPHE policy.\nTo support the use of telehealth services, the NYS Medicaid program will continue to cover services delivered\nvia audio-visual telehealth, when appropriate, if such member chooses to receive telehealth services in lieu\nof an in-person visit. An audio-visual visit must contain all elements of the billable procedure codes or rate\ncodes and all required documentation.\nAudio-only services will also continue to be covered when audio-visual services are not available or when the\nmember chooses audio-only services in lieu of audio-visual telehealth or an in-person visit. Audio-only visits\nmust contain all elements of the billable procedure codes or rate codes and all required documentation.\nProviders must document in the chart of the NYS Medicaid member why audio-only services were used for\neach audio-only encounter.\nThis guidance does not change any other NYS Medicaid program requirements, with respect to authorized\nservices or provider enrollment, and does not expand authorization to bill NYS Medicaid beyond service\nproviders who are currently enrolled to bill Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) or contracted with a Medicaid\nManaged Care (MMC) Plan.\n",

To view the official PHE announcement, providers can\nrefer to the HHS “Public Health Emergency Declarations” web page at: https://www.phe.gov/\nemergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx. For more information on the federal PHE wind down,\nproviders can refer to the Unwinding and Returning to Regular Operations after COVID-19 web page, located\nat: https://www.medicaid.gov/resources-for-states/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/unwinding-and-retu\nrning-regular-operations-after-covid-19/index.html.\nAs NY prepares for the transition out of the PHE, the move to resume eligibility reviews could result in a large\nnumber of beneficiaries becoming disenrolled. The NYS Department of Health (DOH) is working with partners,\nlocal districts, and other stakeholders to inform consumers about renewing their coverage and exploring other\navailable health insurance options if they no longer qualify for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nDOH’s Strategy\nFederal guidance allows States 14 months to redetermine eligibility with 60 days advanced notice. In NY, this\nmeans renewing eligibility for 8.8 million people, including:\n• 1.4 million new enrollees who have never renewed coverage with DOH, and\n• 7.4 million who have not renewed their coverage in more than two years.\nAs part of this effort, DOH will update consumer notices and eligibility and enrollment systems. Consumers\nwill be sent renewal notices describing the action needed, if any, to renew their coverage. To manage the\nvolume, consumers will maintain their regular renewal “cycles” so that approximately one out of 12 of the\npopulation will renew each month. Additional details about this timeline will be delivered when HHS\nannounces the end date of the PHE.\nCommunications\nAdditionally, a public education campaign has been initiated by NY State of Health, the state’s official\nMarketplace. The campaign will:\n• prepare Medicaid, CHP and EP enrollees for the renewal process, communicate upcoming changes\nand encourage consumers to opt into NY State of Health text messages that will alert them when it is\ntime to renew their coverage (New Yorkers can sign up for text alerts by texting START to 1-866-988-\n0327);\n• remind consumers to update their contact information to ensure renewal information from the\nMarketplace reaches them; and\n• ensure consumers take the necessary steps to renew coverage and transition to other coverage if\nthey are no longer eligible for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nFor more information regarding NY State of Health’s communications prior to the end of the PHE, visit the NY\nState of Health Important Changes Are Coming to New York Medicaid, Child Health Plus and the Essential\nPlan web page, located at: https://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/COVID-19-Changes.\nJune 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 10\n\nHelp Us Spread the Word\nAn outreach toolkit, located on the NY State of Health “Unwinding from the COVID-19 Public Health\nEmergency: A Communications Tool Kit to Keep New Yorkers Covered” web page, at:\nhttps://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/PHE-tool-kit, is available to help prepare consumers for the changes\ncoming once the PHE ends. Providers can use these regularly updated resources to help communicate with\ntheir patients enrolled in Medicaid, CHP or EP about the important steps they need to take to maintain their\nhealth coverage.\nQuestions\nFor questions or feedback, providers should email pheunwind@health.ny.gov.\n",

APGs\nare classified and reimbursed using software developed and published by 3M Health Information Systems\n(3M). FQHCs/RHCS that choose to be reimbursed via the APG reimbursement methodology cannot be\nnegatively impacted in their NYS Medicaid reimbursement due to opting into the alternative rate-setting\nmethodology. If a facility’s NYS Medicaid reimbursement under APGs is lower than what their payment would\nhave been under the all-inclusive PPS rate, the facility is entitled to receive a supplemental payment reflecting\nthe difference between the amount paid to them under APGs and what they would have been paid using the\nall-inclusive PPS rate. Providers should refer to the NYS Department of Health (DOH) “Federally Qualified\nHealth Center (FQHC)” web page, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/rates/fqhc/, for\nadditional information relative to the alternative rate-setting methodology.\nFQHCs/RHCs that opt to receive payment via the APG reimbursement methodology should refer to the NYS\nDOH “Ambulatory Patient Groups (APGs)” web page, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/\nmedicaid/rates/apg/, for additional information pertaining to rates, 3M Versions of the Definition Manual and\nCrosswalk, reimbursement components, regulations, policies, and APG weights.\nMedicaid Managed Care\nUnder federal law, NYS is required to make supplemental payments to FQHCs/RHCs pursuant to a contract\nbetween the FQHCs/RHCs and a Managed Care Organization (MCO) and/or Independent Practice\nAssociation (IPA) for the amount, if any, the FQHCs/RHCs FFS NYS Medicaid rate exceeds the amount of\npayment provided under the Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) contract for the services rendered by the\nFQHC/RHC. These supplemental payments are made directly from NYS to FQHCs and RHCs via FFS claim\nsubmission, using rate code “1609”.\nEffective January 1, 2022, FQHCs and RHCs should no longer report any commercial insurance payments\non their NYS Medicaid FFS supplemental claim submissions. This change will ensure that FQHCs and RHCs\nreceive the complete supplemental payment. NYS Medicaid timely filing limits do apply and are enforceable\nfor all supplemental claims submitted via rate code “1609”.\nMarch 2024 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 6\n\nProviders should refer to the NYS Managed Care Supplemental Payment Program for FQHCs Policy\nDocument, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/rates/fqhc/fqhc_policy_document\n.htm, and the Update to Fee-for-Service Reimbursement for Federally Qualified Health Center Claims After\nThird-Party Payers and Managed Care Visit and Revenue Reporting Requirements article published in the\nJanuary 2022 issue of the Medicaid Update, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care\n/medicaid/program/update/2022/docs/mu_no1_jan22_pr.pdf, for additional information pertaining to the NYS\nMedicaid FFS supplemental rate calculation and payment policy.\nAdditionally, NYS Medicaid FFS is also required to make payments to FQHCs/RHCs for visits made by a\nMMC enrollee that are unpaid by the plan or not covered by a contract between the FQHC/RHC and MCO/IPA.\nIn these situations, the State will reimburse FQHCs/RHCs the full FQHC/RHC rate.

General Billing Guidelines for Dual Eligible Enrollees\nPursuant to federal law, Medicaid is the payer of last resort, which means Medicaid will make payments only\nafter all other sources of reimbursement have been exhausted. Therefore, potential third-party reimbursement\nsources including Medicare, must be billed prior to billing Medicaid. For additional information, providers can\nrefer to the following NYS Medicaid billing guidance for dual enrollees:\n• NYS DOH, OMH, OASAS “Duals Reimbursement in MMC” memorandum, located at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/managed_care/plans/docs/2021-12-01_duals_reimbursement\n_mmc.pdf.\n• NYS DOH, OMH, OASAS Medicaid Managed Care Billing Guidance for Dual Eligible Enrollees policy\nguidance, located at: https://omh.ny.gov/omhweb/bho/policy-guidance/billing_for_dual_eligible_enroll\nees.pdf.\nFor dually enrolled Medicare and NYS Medicaid members, if Medicare covers the telehealth encounter, NYS\nMedicaid will reimburse the Part B coinsurance and deductible to the extent permitted by NYS law. For\nbenefits covered by Medicare, any telehealth restrictions set by Medicare apply to dually-enrolled members\nunless otherwise stated in policy, located on the CMS “List of Telehealth Services” web page at:\nhttps://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-Information/Telehealth/Telehealth-Codes.\nNew York State Medicaid Update Special Edition pg. 10\n\nThe Performance Enhancement Reform Act, or omnibus budget for federal fiscal year (FY) 2023, included\nseveral provisions that extend telehealth flexibilities for federal programs through December 31, 2024. Several\nflexibilities apply to Medicare’s coverage of telehealth, including suspending geography-based telehealth\nrequirements, allowing audio-only telehealth, patient homes as originating sites, FQHCs and RHCs to\ncontinue to offer telehealth, and delaying in-person visit requirements prior to delivering mental health services\nvia telehealth. When such flexibilities end, NYS Medicaid coverage of some services via telehealth for those\ndually enrolled may be impacted. For additional information, providers can refer to the Congress “House\nCommittee Print 117-59 - RULES COMMITTEE PRINT 117-59 TEXT OF H.R. 4040, THE ADVANCING\nTELEHEALTH BEYOND COVID-19 ACT OF 2021 [Showing the text of H.R. 4040, as introduced, with\nmodifications.]” web page, located at: https://www.congress.gov/committee-print/117th-congress/house-\ncommittee-print/48141.\nF. Telephonic (Audio-only) Reimbursement Overview\n1. Following the COVID-19 PHE, when audio-only telehealth is used in accordance with the policy\noutlined in “II. Telehealth Definitions”, “G. Telephonic (Audio-only)” on page 4 of this issue,\nproviders may bill NYS Medicaid as they would for an in-person or audio-visual telehealth visit (using\nthe appropriate procedure or rate code).\na. Services provided via audio-only visits shall contain all elements of the billable procedures or\nrate codes and must meet all documentation requirements as if provided in person or via an\naudio-visual visit.\nb. Audio-only rate codes used during the COVID-19 PHE will be retired. FQHCs can bill the\nProspective Payment System (PPS) rate code “4012” or “4013”, depending on on-site\npresence as outlined in “VII. Billing Rules for Telehealth Services”, “M. FFS Billing for\nTelehealth by Site and Location” on page 14 of this issue. Wrap payments are available for\nany telehealth services, including telephonic services reimbursed by an MMC Plan, under\nqualifying PPS and off-site rate codes.\nc. Audio-only E&M procedure codes “99441” through “99443” will continue to be billable, though\nas of the date of this guidance, 151-days post COVID-19 PHE, Medicare will no longer cover\ncodes “99441” through “99443”.\n2.

The CPT code billed should be appended with the applicable telehealth modifier.\nPractitioners providing services via telehealth should confirm with the nursing facility whether their services\nare in the nursing home rate.\nP. MMC Considerations:\n1. MMC Plans are required to cover, at a minimum, services that are covered by NYS Medicaid FFS\nand included in the MMC benefit package, when determined medically necessary and must provide\ntelehealth coverage as described in this guidance. To allow DOH to adequately track telehealth use,\nMMC Plans must ensure claims allow the use of the telehealth modifiers established in this guidance\nand may establish additional claiming requirements beyond those set out in the FFS billing\ninstructions in this guidance.\n2.

FQHCs That Have \"Opted Into\" APGs: FQHCs that have \"opted into\" APGs should follow the billing\nguidance outlined above for sites billing under APGs.\n2. FQHCs That Have Not \"Opted Into\" APGs - FQHC Originating Sites:\na. Consistent with Medicaid telehealth guidance issued in February 2019, when services are\nprovided via telemedicine to a patient located at an FQHC originating site, the originating site\nmay bill only the FQHC off-site services rate code (“4012”) to recoup administrative expenses\nassociated with the telemedicine encounter.\nb. When a separate and distinct medical service, unrelated to the telemedicine encounter, is\nprovided by a qualified practitioner at the FQHC originating site, the originating site may bill\nthe Prospective Payment System (PPS) rate in addition to the FQHC off-site services rate code\n(“4012”).\n3. FQHCs That Have Not \"Opted Into\" APGs – FQHC Distant Sites:\na. If a provider who is on-site at an FQHC or is providing service from the practitioner’s home\nduring the PHE via telemedicine to a member who is in their place of residence or other location\nincluding an originating site that is another provider’s office or clinic, the FQHC may bill the\nPPS rate and report the applicable modifier (“95” or “GT”) on the procedure code line.\n4. Wrap payments are available for any telehealth services, including telephonic services reimbursed by\nan MMC Plan, under qualifying PPS and off-site rate codes.\nD. Application-Specific Telehealth Billing Rules\nTelephonic (Audio-only)\nSee Section II: Telephonic Reimbursement Overview.\nStore-and-Forward Technology\n1. Reimbursement will be made to the consulting distant-site practitioner.\n2. The consulting distant-site practitioner must provide the requesting originating-site practitioner with a\nwritten report of the consultation in order for payment to be made.\n3. The consulting practitioner should bill the CPT code for the professional service appended with the\ntelehealth modifier \"GQ”.\nRemote Patient Monitoring (RPM)\n1. Telehealth services provided by means of RPM should be billed using CPT code \"99091\" [Collection\nand interpretation of physiologic data (e.g., Electrocardiography {ECG}, blood pressure, glucose\nmonitoring) digitally stored and/or transmitted by the patient and/or caregiver to the physician or other\nqualified health care professional, qualified by education, training and licensure/regulation (when\napplicable) requiring a minimum of 30 minutes of time].\n2. A fee of $48.00 per month will be paid for RPM.\n3. Providers are not to bill \"99091\" more than one time per member per month.\nJune 2021 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 11\n\nE. Medicaid Managed Care Considerations\n1. MMC Plans are required to cover, at a minimum, services that are covered by Medicaid FFS and also\nincluded in the MMC benefit package, when determined medically necessary and must provide\ntelehealth coverage as described in this guidance. MMC Plans may establish claiming requirements\n(e.g., specialized coding) that vary from FFS billing instructions in this guidance.\n2. Absent existing state mandated rates or negotiated rates for telehealth/telephonic services, MMC\nPlans must reimburse network providers at the same rate that would be reimbursed for providing the\nsame service via a face-to-face encounter.\n3. MMC Plans may not limit member access to telehealth/telephonic services to solely the MMC Plans\ntelehealth vendors and must cover appropriate telehealth/telephonic services provided by other\nnetwork providers.\n4. Questions regarding MMC reimbursement and/or documentation requirements should be directed to\nthe member's MMC Plan.\nVIII.

Such audit or inspection would be\nperformed by the NYS Department of Health (Department), Office of the Medicaid Inspector General\n(OMIG), the Office of the State Comptroller (OSC), the NYS Office of the Attorney General and/or other\nstate or federal agencies, for the period required by federal or state statute, regulation, policy or contract.\nAdditionally, for any claims submitted to NYS Medicaid with a zero-fill reimbursement from Medicare or\nother third-party insurers, providers must retain evidence that the claims were denied by the other insurers\nbefore seeking reimbursement from NYS Medicaid. Exceptions to this policy would be for claims reflecting\nitems or services that are statutorily not covered by the Medicare program. Providers may bill NYS Medicaid\ndirectly without receiving denials from Medicare for these exceptions. Providers are responsible for retaining\nthe statutory exemption from Medicare for audit or inspection.\nThe Department reviewed zero-filled claim submissions and collected information from providers for\nanalysis of claims. These reviews and subsequent analysis are meant to assist providers with proper claim\nsubmission and appropriate use of zero-fill.

If the condition of the patient requires extended hospital care, a decision to admit as an inpatient\nshould be made. Observation status is intended for cases where it is initially unclear whether inpatient\nadmission is necessary or if the patient may be safely discharged.\nObservation status does not require an inpatient admission order. Instead, a physician or qualified practitioner\nplaces the patient in observation to assess the need for inpatient care. Documentation should indicate the\nneed for ongoing monitoring, evaluation, or additional testing to support this determination. Additional\ninformation can be found in the Direct Omit for Observation Services article published in the August 2016\nissue of the Medicaid Update, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program\n/update/2016/aug16_mu.pdf.\nUtilization Review\nHospitals must be diligent in their review of inpatient admissions to ensure compliance with NYS Medicaid\nbilling policies and the medical necessity requirements for inpatient claims. This involves thoroughly\nevaluating whether the medical factors documented in the medical record support the appropriateness of the\ninpatient admission, the duration of the stay and the professional services, including drugs and biologicals.\nUtilization review teams play a critical role in verifying that these criteria are met before submitting a claim to\nNYS Medicaid. All supporting documentation must be retained for ten years from the date of payment and\nmade available upon request to substantiate the claim during post-payment reviews.\nProvider Responsibilities\nTo comply with NYS Medicaid billing policies, providers must ensure their staff have a thorough understanding\nof billing requirements for inpatient admissions and observation status. Ongoing staff education, routine\ninternal audits, and regular evaluations of billing practices and workflows are critical for identifying and\nresolving gaps in compliance, documentation accuracy, and adherence to NYS Medicaid policies. By\nimplementing these measures, providers can ensure inpatient claim submissions meet NYS Medicaid\nstandards and strengthen utilization review processes.\nJanuary 2025 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 3\n\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• Fee-for-service (FFS) claim questions should be directed to the eMedNY Call Center at (800) 343-\n9000.\n• FFS coverage and policy questions should be directed to the Office of Health Insurance Programs\nDivision of Program Development and Management by telephone at (518) 473-2160 or by email at\nFFSMedicaidPolicy@health.ny.gov.\n• Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) reimbursement, billing, and/or documentation requirement questions\nshould be directed to the MMC Plan of the enrollee.

Treatment in place\nmust be provided by a licensed healthcare practitioner [physician, nurse practitioner (NP), or physician\nassistant (PA)], either in person or via telehealth. Non-hospital alternative destinations include Community\nMental Health Centers (CMHCs), substance use disorder treatment centers, Federally Qualified Health\nCenters (FQHCs), physician’s offices, and urgent care facilities. For more information about the ET3 Model\nin NYS Medicaid, providers can refer to the article titled The CMS Emergency Triage, Treat, and Transport\nModel with the Department of Health Parallel Model, published in the November 2021 issue of the Medicaid\nUpdate, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2021/docs/mu\n_no13_nov21_pr.pdf.\nNYS Department of Health (DOH) is pleased to announce that on February 16, 2022, NYS Medicaid\npaid its first ET3 ambulance claim for treatment in place. This service and payment model offers flexibility\nto ambulance providers to best address the care and needs of Medicaid members they treat, in response to\n911 calls. ET3 offers the ability to deliver the right care in the right environment and reduce ED overcrowding.\nThrough this model, NYS Medicaid promotes person-centered care by giving members more treatment\noptions as well as encouraging appropriate and efficient utilization of services that reduce strain on EMS\nsystems. All CMS ET3-approved ambulance providers are encouraged to participate in NYS Medicaid’s\nparallel model. A list of all CMS ET3 Model Selected Applicants, located at: https://innovation\n.cms.gov/files/x/et3-selected-applicants.pdf, is available and includes twenty-five NYS ambulance services.\nQuestions\nAll ET3-specific questions should be directed to the NYS DOH, Medical Transportation Unit by telephone at\n(518) 473-2160 or by email at MedTrans@health.ny.gov.\n",

Pages four (4) through five (5) of the list of invited ambulance services contain the NYS invitees. The\nCMS ET3 Model aims to reduce expenditures and preserve or enhance quality of care by:\n• Providing person-centered care, such that beneficiaries receive the appropriate level of care\ndelivered safely at the right time and place while having greater control of their healthcare through the\navailability of more options.\n• Encouraging appropriate utilization of services to meet health care needs effectively.\n• Increasing efficiency in the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system to more readily respond\nto and focus on high-acuity emergency cases.\nCurrently, Medicare only pays for ground ambulance services when beneficiaries are transported to specific\ntypes of facilities. In an emergency setting, this is most often a hospital emergency department (ED), even\nwhen an alternative treatment option may be more appropriate. As part of the ET3 Model, CMS (and NYS\nMedicaid) will be testing two new ambulance payments. While continuing to pay for emergency\ntransportation of a Medicare beneficiary to a hospital ED, under the ET3 Model, Medicare will also pay\nparticipating ambulance suppliers and providers to:\n• Transport a beneficiary to an alternative destination (such as an urgent care clinic, federally qualified\nhealthcare center, hospital outpatient department, freestanding clinic or a physician’s office which over\ntime should include a priority to transport to the patient’s medical home/PCP as possible), or;\n• Initiate and facilitate treatment in place by a qualified health care practitioner, either in-person on the\nscene, or via telehealth. In this context, a qualified health care practitioner is limited to a physician,\nphysician’s assistant, nurse practitioner or, when appropriate for the patient, a licensed mental health\ncare professional.\nUpon arriving on the scene of a 911 call, participating ambulance suppliers and providers may triage\nbeneficiaries to one of the ET3 Model interventions. This requires the participating ambulance suppliers and\nproviders to partner with alternative destinations and with qualified health care practitioners to deliver\ntreatment in place (either on-the-scene or through telehealth). A patient can always choose to be brought to\nan ED if he or she prefers.\nAny ambulance supplier or provider approved to participate in the ET3 Model by CMS, may apply to NYS\nMedicaid for participation in a Medicaid parallel ET3 Model. The NYS Medicaid ET3 Model will mirror both\nthe timing and the tenets of the CMS ET3 Model.\n• The applicable base rate and mileage payment will be made for the transportation of a beneficiary to\nan alternative destination (such as an urgent care clinic, federally qualified healthcare center,\nhospital outpatient department, freestanding clinic or a physician’s office).\n• The applicable base rate payment will be made when an approved ambulance supplier or provider\ninitiates and facilitates treatment in place by a qualified health care practitioner, either in-person on\nthe scene, or via telehealth.\n• Payment to a qualified heath care practitioner or an alternative destination will be made separately,\nand in accordance with the appropriate NYS Medicaid fee schedule or plan negotiated payment.\nDecember 2020 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 6\n\nTo apply for participation in the NYS Medicaid ET3 Model, a CMS-approved ambulance supplier or\nprovider must submit:\n• Written confirmation of the CMS approval for its participation in the CMS ET3 Model. Ambulance\nproviders or suppliers that have not been approved by CMS are ineligible for participation in\nNYS Medicaid ET3 Model.\n• A copy of the submitted CMS ET3 Model application and all supporting documents.\n• An affirmation, signed by the chief executive officer of the organization, agreeing to provide the NYS\nDepartment of Health (DOH) with copies of all quality improvement and other reports required by\nCMS.\n• Evidence of outreach to Medicaid managed care organizations (MCOs) in the region to coordinate\nnetwork and payment issues for both treat in place (including telehealth) and alternative\ndestinations.\nAll applications and any questions on the Medicaid component of the ET3 Model may be submitted\nelectronically to medtrans@health.ny.gov.\n",

Providers should not routinely refer calls\nto an emergency room, unless the Medicaid member is experiencing a life-threatening health emergency.\nPlease Note: Providers are required to schedule appointments in accordance with appointment and availability\nstandards noted above to be determined compliant with access to care requirements when contacted by an\nMMC Plan member. Providers must not require a new patient to complete prerequisites to schedule an\nappointment, such as:\n• a copy of their medical record;\n• a health screening questionnaire; and/or\n• an immunization record.\nThe provider may request additional information from the new Medicaid member, if the appointment is scheduled\nat the time of the telephone request. The Department considers prerequisites to scheduling appointments as\nbarriers in gaining access to health care services.

It contains general information regarding New York State’s (NYS) transition\nstrategy and other important facts that will assist providers in transitioning members to the FFS Pharmacy\nProgram.

The\nPharmacy Carve-Out does not apply to members enrolled in Managed Long-Term Care plans (e.g., MLTC,\nPACE and MAP), the Essential Plan, or Child Health Plus (CHP). Transitioning the pharmacy benefit from\nMC to FFS will provide the State with full visibility into prescription drug costs, allow centralization of the\nbenefit, leverage negotiation power, and provide a single drug formulary with standardized utilization\nmanagement protocols simplifying and streamlining the drug benefit for Medicaid members.\nScope of Benefits\nThe FFS Pharmacy Carve-Out will not change the scope (e.g. copayments, covered drugs, etc.) of the\nexisting Medicaid Pharmacy benefit, which includes:\n• Covered outpatient prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs that are listed on the Medicaid\nPharmacy List of Reimbursable Drugs;\n• Pharmacist administered vaccines and supplies listed in the Pharmacy Procedures and Supply Codes\ndocument, such as enteral and parenteral nutrition, family planning, and medical/surgical supplies.\nThe complete list of items subject to the Pharmacy Benefit Carve-Out can be reviewed in the Carve-Out\nScope web page. Please Note: Physician administered (J-Code) drugs that are not listed on the Medicaid\nPharmacy List of Reimbursable Drugs and durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies\n(DMEPOS) as listed in sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7 of the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics and\nSupplies Manual are not subject to the carve-out.

This expansion, approved on March 24, 2022 by the Centers\nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in State Plan Amendment (SPA) #21-0026, includes sickle cell\ndisease (SCD) as a single qualifying condition for Health Homes Serving Adults (HHSA) and Health Homes\nServing Children (HHSC). Please note: Medicaid State Plan Amendment (#21–0026) can be accessed via\nthe NYS DOH “Medicaid Health Homes - State Plan Amendments” web page, located at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/medicaid_health_homes/med_spa.htm.\nIndividuals enrolled in the NYS Medicaid Health Home program must also meet appropriateness criteria,\nwhich includes significant behavioral, medical, or social risk factors requiring intensive care management\nservices, and have:\n• two or more chronic conditions, or\n• one single qualifying condition, such as:\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or\nserious mental illness (SMI) (adults), or\nserious emotional disturbances (SED), or\ncomplex trauma (children), or\nnew: SCD.\nThe inclusion of SCD as a single qualifying condition recognizes the unique challenges in access to services\nfaced by individuals with SCD, their families and/or supports. One key focus is to ensure effective transition\nof young adults with SCD from pediatric to adult care. These individuals often face difficulty accessing\nservices, including finding adult specialists who accept patients with SCD, who understand SCD, and who\nacknowledge the patient’s readiness for self-management. Additional challenges include:\n• managing the comorbidities associated with SCD,\n• understanding pain and pain control/management issues,\n• recognizing self-care and self-efficacy,\n• acknowledging and addressing social determinants of health,\n• connecting to community support services (such as peer supports) and appropriate educational\ninformation.\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• Questions should be directed to the Health Home program at healthhomes@health.ny.gov.\n• For information regarding the implementation of the NYS Medicaid Health Home program, providers\ncan refer to the April 2012 Special Edition Medicaid Update titled Introducing Health Homes Improving\nCare for Medicaid Recipients with Chronic Conditions, available at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2012/april12muspec.pdf.\n",

Additional information regarding NYS PCMH can be found on the NCQA\n“New York State Patient-Centered Medical Home (NYS PCMH) Recognition Program” web page, located at:\nhttps://www.ncqa.org/programs/health-care-providers-practices/state-and-government-recognition/nys-\npatient-centered-medical-home/.\nProviders that achieve NYS PCMH recognition are eligible to receive payments provided in the form of either\nper member per month (PMPM) capitation payments for Medicaid Managed Care (MMC), including\nmainstream NYS Medicaid, Health and Recovery Plans (HARPs), and Human Immunodeficiency Virus-\nSpecial Needs Plans (HIV-SNPs), and Child Health Plus (CHPlus) members; or as a per-visit \"add-on\"\npayment for eligible claims billed for services provided to NYS Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) members.\nProviders should refer to Column A in the “NYS PCMH Payment” table below.\nNYS PCMH Managed Care Incentive\nRetroactive to April 1, 2024, primary care providers recognized under the NYS PCMH program are entitled to\nan incentive enhancement of $4.00/PMPM for MMC enrollees and CHPlus members under 21 years of age,\nand $2.00/PMPM for individuals 21 years of age and older, in addition to the current $6.00/PMPM payment.\nMMC Plans will be expected to calculate retroactive payments and furnish these payments to NYS PCMH-\nrecognized providers in their networks. In 2025, to receive this enhanced incentive payment (in addition to\nthe $6.00/PMPM), providers will be required to develop a workflow to refer patients to a Social Care Network\n(SCN) and submit an attestation by March 31, 2025, confirming their SCN participation. From April 1, 2024\nthrough March 31, 2025, all NYS PCMH providers will receive the incentive enhancement. Providers should\nrefer to Column B in the “NYS PCMH Payment” table below.\nEffective April 1, 2025, NYS PCMH providers that submit SCN attestation by March 31, 2025, will continue\nto receive the incentive enhancement. Providers should refer to Column C in the “NYS PCMH Payment” table\nbelow. NYS PCMH providers that do not attest to participation in an SCN will receive the $6.00/PMPM NYS\nPCMH payment without the incentive enhancement. Providers should refer to Column D in the “NYS PCMH\nPayment” table below.\nPCMH practices can submit attestations after the March 31, 2025 deadline and the PCMH practice will be\nincluded in the subsequent participation list for the additional $2.00 and $4.00 enhancement. PCMH practices\nthat submit attestations after March 31, 2025 will forfeit the $2.00 and $4.00 enhancement beginning April 1,\n2025 until the attestation is received. NYS DOH will release more details about the attestation form and\nprocess in the coming weeks. The attestation form will be available on the NYS Health Commerce System\n(HCS) website, located at: https://commerce.health.state.ny.us/.\nThe attestation will be completed once, per physical site location, covering all recognized providers at that\nlocation. In preparation, practices should check access to their NYS Health Commerce website accounts. A\nlink to the attestation form will be emailed to all NYS PCMH practices for completion using the NYS PCMH\ncontact email address(es) on file with NCQA.\nOctober 2024 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 10\n\nIn order for MMC, HARP, HIV SNP, and CHPlus plans to calculate PCMH incentive enhancement payment,\nthere will be an “SCN Indicator” on the monthly NYS PCMH file posted to the Health Commerce System that\nwill track provider completion of the attestation. Plans will calculate provider payment based on the information\ncorresponding to the “SCN Indicator”.\nSCNs have been established via the NYS DOH 1115 Waiver Amendment, “New York Health Equity Reform”\n(NYHER). NYS DOH recently announced contracts with regional entities, which will serve as lead entities for\nthe regional SCNs. SCNs are developing networks of community-based organizations to deliver social care\nservices to eligible NYS Medicaid members. NYS Medicaid members will be screened using the Centers for\nMedicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Accountable Health Communities Health-Related Social Needs Tool,\nlocated at: https://www.cms.gov/priorities/innovation/files/worksheets/ahcm-screeningtool.pdf, and those with\nunmet social needs will r",

The pharmacy is responsible for using professional judgement in filling prescriptions without\nregard to restriction requirements if the prescriptions were written as part of an emergency department visit\nand the assigned PCP is unavailable (i.e., after hours) to verify the prescriptions. The pharmacy is responsible\nfor contacting the assigned PCP the next business day regarding the prescriptions obtained by the recipient.\nAn assigned primary inpatient hospital is responsible for providing all non-emergency inpatient services to the\nrestricted recipient except for services provided pursuant to an authorized referral.\nEmergency Pharmacy Situations\nIn the event of an emergency, such as drug shortages, unexpected pharmacy closures, and/or unexpected\ntravel, providers and pharmacies must refer to the instructions and contact information provided below.\nDuring normal business hours, the restricted recipient can obtain a temporary authorization to fill the\nprescription at an alternate pharmacy location by contacting:\n• the New York State (NYS) Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG)\nCall (518) 474-6866 or email omig.sm.rrp@omig.ny.gov (available Monday through Friday\nfrom 8 a.m. through 4 p.m.).\n• the local Department of Social Services (LDSS), if the restricted recipient received health coverage\nvia LDSS (Upstate residents).\nProviders and pharmacies should refer to the NYS Department of Health “Local Departments\nof Social Services (LDSS)” web page, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care\n/medicaid/ldss.htm.\n• the New York City (NYC) Human Resources Association (HRA), if the restricted recipient received\nhealth coverage via NYC HRA (NYC-residents).\nCall (888) 692-6116.\n• NY State of Health (NYSOH), if the restricted recipient obtained health coverage via NYSOH.\nCall (518) 457-0761 or email hxrestrict@health.ny.gov.\nDuring nights and weekends, the pharmacy can obtain a prior authorization (PA) by contacting the eMedNY\nCall Center by telephone at (800) 343-9000 (available Monday through Friday from 4 p.m. through 10 p.m.\nand Saturday and Sunday from 8:30 a.m. through 5:30 p.m.).\nJanuary 2025 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 7\n\nAdditional Information\nThe goal of the RRP is to coordinate medical services and improve quality of care for NYS Medicaid members.\nCoordination of care reduces the potential over-utilization of health care services and prevents abusive or\nfraudulent behavior. A restriction is implemented if it is found that a recipient has received duplicative,\nexcessive, contraindicated, or conflicting health care services, drugs, or supplies, or if a recipient commits\nfraudulent acts with their benefit card (i.e., forged prescriptions, card loaning, doctor shopping). The RRP may\nrestrict the recipient to care provided by a PCP, inpatient hospital, and/or primary pharmacy.\nAdditional information regarding the RRP can be found on the NYS OMIG “About the Recipient Restriction\nProgram (RRP)” web page, located at: https://omig.ny.gov/information-resources/about-recipient-restriction-\nprogram-rrp.\n",

RRP is administered by the Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG) in\ncoordination with local Departments of Social Services (LDSS). The objectives of RRP include:\n• providing NYS Medicaid members with coordinated medical and pharmacy services, thus improving\nthe quality of their care;\n• reducing the inappropriate utilization of health care by identifying NYS Medicaid members exhibiting\nabusive or fraudulent behavior; and\n• utilizing Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) Plans and community providers to provide specific specialty\nand case management services. MMC Plans may add or modify restrictions only with the approval of\nOMIG.\nNYS Medicaid members who have been restricted as part of RRP to a designated health care provider\n(i.e., physician or clinic, hospital) or pharmacy are required to receive care only from the designated\nhealth care provider or pharmacy. A primary pharmacy is responsible for identifying the ordering prescriber\nand managing the delivery of medications.\nIt is important to remember that the primary health care provider, whether a physician, hospital, or clinic, is\nresponsible for the provision of most health care services for the restricted NYS Medicaid member. A referral\nwill be needed from these primary health care providers for any non-emergency medical services rendered\nby similar providers, including the ordering of transportation or prescriptions.\nWhen a restricted NYS Medicaid member is assigned to a designated provider and pharmacy, the provider\nand pharmacy will receive a letter informing them that the restricted NYS Medicaid member is restricted to\nthem. The letter also details the referral process. Additionally, the recipient is notified via the Notice of Intent\nto Restrict, which informs them of their restriction, their assigned providers, as well as their fair hearing\ninstructions.\nClaims submitted for a restricted NYS Medicaid member will be denied if the information of the\nprimary care provider is not included on the claim as the referring provider. Providers with questions\nregarding the submission of claims should contact eMedNY Provider Services at (800) 343-9000 or refer to\nthe provider manuals located on the eMedNY homepage, at: https://www.emedny.org/.\nBilling a Referral for a Restricted Recipient\nAs a result of the NYRx Pharmacy Benefit Transition, pharmacy services (outpatient prescriptions) for MMC\nenrollees are now being billed through NYRx, the NYS Medicaid Pharmacy Program, on a fee-for-service\n(FFS) basis. Medical claims for restricted MMC enrollees should follow guidelines established by the MMC\nPlan of the enrollee. Proper billing procedures for FFS recipients and the NYS Medicaid Pharmacy Program\nfor restricted recipients are explained below.\nApril 2023 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 8\n\nNYS Medicaid Claims\nFor NYS Medicaid claims, providers should refer to page 17 of the NYS Medicaid General Billing Guidelines\n– Professional, located at: https://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/AllProviders/General_Billing_Guide\nlines_Professional.pdf.

Children who enter foster care placement receive a dental\nscreening during their initial medical assessment. It is required that children in foster care are up to three\nyears of age have their mouths examined at such medical examination and, where appropriate, referred for\ndental care. Children in foster care over the age of three are required to see a dentist at minimum, once a\nyear, and must be provided dental care when needed.\nChildren may enter foster care having never seen a dentist. It is critical that these children receive expedited\naccess to care. Providers must consider making an extra effort to accommodate these children into their\ndental practice by ensuring availability of appointments. As a reminder, the cost of analgesic and anesthetic\nagents, including nitrous oxide, is included in the reimbursement for dental services under the NYS Medicaid\ndental policy, which is available in the eMedNY New York State Medicaid Program Dental Policy and\nProcedure Code Manual, located at: https://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/Dental/PDFS/Dental_\nPolicy_and_Procedure_Manual.pdf.

The\nMedicaid-covered children/youth in foster care can either be in the care of Voluntary Foster Care Agencies\n(VFCAs) or be in foster homes certified by Local Departments of Social Services (LDSS) statewide. Their\nenrollment in MMCP can include Mainstream MMCP and HIV Special Needs Plans (HIV-SNP).\nBeginning in February 2021, the State will license qualified VFCAs pursuant to Article 29-I of the New York\nState Public Health Law (visit: http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/lawssrch.cgi?NVLWO: for Laws of New York,\nthen select “PBH” for Public Health, then navigate to Article 29-I) to deliver a limited set of health-related\nservices to children/youth in their care. In accordance with the 29-I Health Facility Billing Guidance, Medicaid\nwill cover health and behavioral health services provided to eligible children/youth by licensed 29-I Health\nFacilities. Effective July 1, 2021, MMC Plans will begin covering 29-I Health Facility services for their\neligible members.\nEffective February 1, 2021, the Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) Program will update the Medicaid Foster\nCare Drug Carve-Out List with additional drug(s)/drug classes and products listed on the Preferred Diabetic\nSupply Program. VFCAs will continue to cover the cost of drugs/products that are not included on the Foster\nCare Drug Carve-Out list until June 30, 2021. Effective July 1, 2021, all pharmacy benefits for this\npopulation will be paid for under Medicaid FFS.\nAll providers who deliver services to children/youth in foster care or to children/youth in the care of VFCAs\nshould be aware of this transition. Effective July 1, 2021, VFCAs will no longer be the payor for Medicaid\ncovered services delivered to children/youth in their care, and community providers serving these children will\ndirect claims to the child/youth’s MMCP or the Medicaid FFS, as applicable. To avoid disruption in services\nto children/youth during this transition, providers traditionally serving this population are strongly encouraged\nto enroll in the NYS Medicaid program then engage with MMCP in their area to ensure continued coverage\nfor their patients.\nPolicy requirements for this transition, including continuity of care requirements for transitioning children/youth\nenrolling in Medicaid managed care, 29-I Health Facility rate information, and 29-I Health Facility services\nguidelines, can be located on the Department of Health’s 29-I Health Facility (VFCA Transition) web page.\nQuestions\nAll questions may be directed to BH.transition@health.ny.gov.\n",

The\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is dedicated to improving interoperability and patient\naccess to health information. The NY Medicaid EHR Incentive Program is a part of the CMS Promoting\nInteroperability Program but will continue to operate under the current name of NY Medicaid EHR Incentive\nProgram.\nPayment Year (PY) 2020 Pre-Validation Period\nIf EPs or a group of EPs have already selected their reporting period and calculated their patient volume prior\nto the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program Administrative Support Service (MEIPASS) attestation system being\nopened for the payment year, the EPs are able to complete a pre-validation. This allows practices to submit\ntheir patient volume data for review and approval ahead of attestation and can help the EP advance through\nthe review process more quickly once MEIPASS begins accepting attestations.\nPre-Validations for PY 2020 will be accepted from September 14, 2020 to December 14, 2020. If providers\nwould like to take advantage of this service to avoid patient volume remediation during the official or soft\nopening attestation periods, they need to begin the process of finding a suitable Medicaid patient volume\nreporting period. More information on how to submit a Pre-Validation will be made available as the acceptance\nperiod draws closer.\nCheck Participation Status\nAt minimum*, a provider must have completed and received an incentive payment for one payment year in\nPY 2016 or earlier to participate for future years. Providers uncertain about their participation status are\nencouraged to reach out to the NY Medicaid EHR Incentive Program support team for assistance. Program\nparticipation status can be verified and reviewed using the provider’s National Provider Identifier (NPI) and\nmay assist in determining a provider’s ability to attest in PY 2019-2021. Providers who wish to check their\nparticipation status should contact the support team at (877) 646-5410 (Option 2) or via email\nat: hit@health.ny.gov.\n*Providers must also meet all other relevant program requirements and metrics to be eligible to participate in the NY Medicaid EHR\nIncentive Program.\nLISTSERV Communications\nAdditional information and program changes are announced periodically, especially as the program begins\nits final years. The NY Medicaid EHR Incentive Program uses a LISTSERV messaging system to quickly\ncommunicate any changes or updates and recommends that providers and administrators subscribe in order\nto best be kept up to date. Information and instructions on how to subscribe can be found on the NY Medicaid\nEHR Incentive Program LISTSERV webpage at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/\nredesign/ehr/listserv/index.htm. Providers who experience any difficulty when attempting to subscribe should\ncontact the support team for assistance.\nJuly 2020 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 4\n\nWebinars\nThe NY Medicaid EHR Incentive Program will host quarterly Program Discussion Webinars on a variety of\ntopics identified by support staff and the provider community.

Providers who demonstrate\nMeaningful Use (MU) of their EHR systems are leading the way towards interoperability, which is the ability of\nhealthcare providers to exchange and use patient health records electronically. The ultimate goal is to increase\npatient involvement, reduce costs, and improve health outcomes.\nHow does using EHR promote interoperability?\n• Providers are ensuring that Protected Health Information (PHI) is private, secure, and easily useable by\nthe patient, their family, and by other providers - current and future;\n• There is full and easy access to all electronic health information that is authorized for such; and\n• There is protection against information blocking – when a provider, vendor, or information technology (IT)\ndeveloper knowingly and unreasonably interferes with the exchange and use of electronic health\ninformation. Examples of information blocking include: fees that make data exchange cost prohibitive;\norganizational policies that prohibit the exchange of information; or when patients or health care providers\nbecome “locked in” to a specific technology or health care network because data are not portable.\nImportant Note:\nAll EPs attesting to Payment Year (PY) 2019 Stage 3 MU must use 2015 Certified Electronic Health Record\nTechnology (CEHRT).\nRegister in MURPH: Stage 3 Objective 8 (Public Health)\nEPs must register their intent to submit data to the appropriate Public Health registries before or within 60 days\nfrom the start of their EHR Reporting Period. Providers who are using the EHR period starting January 1, 2019\nfor PY 2019 MU, must register by March 1st, 2019. EPs who previously registered with the Meaningful Use\nRegistration System for Public Health (MURPH) must use or update their existing MURPH registration rather\nthan start a new registration.\nFor questions please contact the New York Medicaid EHR Incentive Program Support Team at: 1-877-646-5410\n(option 3), or via email at: MUPublicHealthHelp@health.ny.gov\nNYS RECs\nNew York State (NYS) Regional Extension Centers (RECs) offer support to help providers meet their objectives.\nAnswers to questions regarding the program and requirements, assistance on selecting and using CEHRT, or\nhelp meeting program objectives is available?
