It also notes that assistance is free for all NY practices/providers. These directly match the bulleted services in the context. Minor broader context about REC roles (optimizing EHR use, supporting transformation/quality/payment reform) and the existence of two RECs with geographic coverage (NYC REACH and NYeC) is not included, which could enhance completeness but is not strictly required to answer the service-focused question.",
