This virus causes a disease called COVID-19 and can lead to fever, cough and\nshortness of breath. There are thousands of confirmed cases in a growing number of countries\ninternationally and the virus is now spreading in the United States.

Reported illnesses have ranged from mild\nrespiratory symptoms, similar to a cold, to severe illness, resulting in pneumonia and even death.\nProviders should have an emergency preparedness plan in place for their facilities. The latest NYS-\nspecific information can be found on the NYSDOH website at the following link:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/coronavirus/.\nThe latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance for healthcare professionals is\navailable at the following link: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/index.html.\nTreatment\nCurrently there is no available antiviral to treat COVID-19, though some international clinical trials are\nunderway.\nVaccine\nAt this point there is not a vaccine for COVID-19.

To view the official PHE announcement, providers can\nrefer to the HHS “Public Health Emergency Declarations” web page at: https://www.phe.gov/\nemergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx. For more information on the federal PHE wind down,\nproviders can refer to the Unwinding and Returning to Regular Operations after COVID-19 web page, located\nat: https://www.medicaid.gov/resources-for-states/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/unwinding-and-retu\nrning-regular-operations-after-covid-19/index.html.\nAs NY prepares for the transition out of the PHE, the move to resume eligibility reviews could result in a large\nnumber of beneficiaries becoming disenrolled. The NYS Department of Health (DOH) is working with partners,\nlocal districts, and other stakeholders to inform consumers about renewing their coverage and exploring other\navailable health insurance options if they no longer qualify for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nDOH’s Strategy\nFederal guidance allows States 14 months to redetermine eligibility with 60 days advanced notice. In NY, this\nmeans renewing eligibility for 8.8 million people, including:\n• 1.4 million new enrollees who have never renewed coverage with DOH, and\n• 7.4 million who have not renewed their coverage in more than two years.\nAs part of this effort, DOH will update consumer notices and eligibility and enrollment systems. Consumers\nwill be sent renewal notices describing the action needed, if any, to renew their coverage. To manage the\nvolume, consumers will maintain their regular renewal “cycles” so that approximately one out of 12 of the\npopulation will renew each month. Additional details about this timeline will be delivered when HHS\nannounces the end date of the PHE.\nCommunications\nAdditionally, a public education campaign has been initiated by NY State of Health, the state’s official\nMarketplace. The campaign will:\n• prepare Medicaid, CHP and EP enrollees for the renewal process, communicate upcoming changes\nand encourage consumers to opt into NY State of Health text messages that will alert them when it is\ntime to renew their coverage (New Yorkers can sign up for text alerts by texting START to 1-866-988-\n0327);\n• remind consumers to update their contact information to ensure renewal information from the\nMarketplace reaches them; and\n• ensure consumers take the necessary steps to renew coverage and transition to other coverage if\nthey are no longer eligible for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nFor more information regarding NY State of Health’s communications prior to the end of the PHE, visit the NY\nState of Health Important Changes Are Coming to New York Medicaid, Child Health Plus and the Essential\nPlan web page, located at: https://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/COVID-19-Changes.\nJune 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 10\n\nHelp Us Spread the Word\nAn outreach toolkit, located on the NY State of Health “Unwinding from the COVID-19 Public Health\nEmergency: A Communications Tool Kit to Keep New Yorkers Covered” web page, at:\nhttps://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/PHE-tool-kit, is available to help prepare consumers for the changes\ncoming once the PHE ends. Providers can use these regularly updated resources to help communicate with\ntheir patients enrolled in Medicaid, CHP or EP about the important steps they need to take to maintain their\nhealth coverage.\nQuestions\nFor questions or feedback, providers should email pheunwind@health.ny.gov.\n",

If a vaccine is developed, this guidance document will\nbe updated.\nTesting of Persons Under Investigation (PUI)\nCurrently COVID-19 tests are being conducted at the CDC, the NYS Wadsworth Center, and the New\nYork City Public Health Laboratory.

The second HCPCS billing code (“U0002”) allows laboratories to bill for non-CDC laboratory\ntests for COVID-19.

To view the official PHE announcement, providers can\nrefer to the HHS “Public Health Emergency Declarations” web page at: https://www.phe.gov/\nemergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx. For more information on the federal PHE wind down,\nproviders can refer to the Unwinding and Returning to Regular Operations after COVID-19 web page, located\nat: https://www.medicaid.gov/resources-for-states/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/unwinding-and-retu\nrning-regular-operations-after-covid-19/index.html.\nAs NY prepares for the transition out of the PHE, the move to resume eligibility reviews could result in a large\nnumber of beneficiaries becoming disenrolled. The NYS Department of Health (DOH) is working with partners,\nlocal districts, and other stakeholders to inform consumers about renewing their coverage and exploring other\navailable health insurance options if they no longer qualify for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nDOH’s Strategy\nFederal guidance allows States 14 months to redetermine eligibility with 60 days advanced notice. In NY, this\nmeans renewing eligibility for 8.8 million people, including:\n• 1.4 million new enrollees who have never renewed coverage with DOH, and\n• 7.4 million who have not renewed their coverage in more than two years.\nAs part of this effort, DOH will update consumer notices and eligibility and enrollment systems. Consumers\nwill be sent renewal notices describing the action needed, if any, to renew their coverage. To manage the\nvolume, consumers will maintain their regular renewal “cycles” so that approximately one out of 12 of the\npopulation will renew each month. Additional details about this timeline will be delivered when HHS\nannounces the end date of the PHE.\nCommunications\nAdditionally, a public education campaign has been initiated by NY State of Health, the state’s official\nMarketplace. The campaign will:\n• prepare Medicaid, CHP and EP enrollees for the renewal process, communicate upcoming changes\nand encourage consumers to opt into NY State of Health text messages that will alert them when it is\ntime to renew their coverage (New Yorkers can sign up for text alerts by texting START to 1-866-988-\n0327);\n• remind consumers to update their contact information to ensure renewal information from the\nMarketplace reaches them; and\n• ensure consumers take the necessary steps to renew coverage and transition to other coverage if\nthey are no longer eligible for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nFor more information regarding NY State of Health’s communications prior to the end of the PHE, visit the NY\nState of Health Important Changes Are Coming to New York Medicaid, Child Health Plus and the Essential\nPlan web page, located at: https://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/COVID-19-Changes.\nJune 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 10\n\nHelp Us Spread the Word\nAn outreach toolkit, located on the NY State of Health “Unwinding from the COVID-19 Public Health\nEmergency: A Communications Tool Kit to Keep New Yorkers Covered” web page, at:\nhttps://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/PHE-tool-kit, is available to help prepare consumers for the changes\ncoming once the PHE ends. Providers can use these regularly updated resources to help communicate with\ntheir patients enrolled in Medicaid, CHP or EP about the important steps they need to take to maintain their\nhealth coverage.\nQuestions\nFor questions or feedback, providers should email pheunwind@health.ny.gov.\n",

To view the official PHE announcement, providers can\nrefer to the HHS “Public Health Emergency Declarations” web page at: https://www.phe.gov/\nemergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx. For more information on the federal PHE wind down,\nproviders can refer to the Unwinding and Returning to Regular Operations after COVID-19 web page, located\nat: https://www.medicaid.gov/resources-for-states/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/unwinding-and-retu\nrning-regular-operations-after-covid-19/index.html.\nAs NY prepares for the transition out of the PHE, the move to resume eligibility reviews could result in a large\nnumber of beneficiaries becoming disenrolled. The NYS Department of Health (DOH) is working with partners,\nlocal districts, and other stakeholders to inform consumers about renewing their coverage and exploring other\navailable health insurance options if they no longer qualify for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nDOH’s Strategy\nFederal guidance allows States 14 months to redetermine eligibility with 60 days advanced notice. In NY, this\nmeans renewing eligibility for 8.8 million people, including:\n• 1.4 million new enrollees who have never renewed coverage with DOH, and\n• 7.4 million who have not renewed their coverage in more than two years.\nAs part of this effort, DOH will update consumer notices and eligibility and enrollment systems. Consumers\nwill be sent renewal notices describing the action needed, if any, to renew their coverage. To manage the\nvolume, consumers will maintain their regular renewal “cycles” so that approximately one out of 12 of the\npopulation will renew each month. Additional details about this timeline will be delivered when HHS\nannounces the end date of the PHE.\nCommunications\nAdditionally, a public education campaign has been initiated by NY State of Health, the state’s official\nMarketplace. The campaign will:\n• prepare Medicaid, CHP and EP enrollees for the renewal process, communicate upcoming changes\nand encourage consumers to opt into NY State of Health text messages that will alert them when it is\ntime to renew their coverage (New Yorkers can sign up for text alerts by texting START to 1-866-988-\n0327);\n• remind consumers to update their contact information to ensure renewal information from the\nMarketplace reaches them; and\n• ensure consumers take the necessary steps to renew coverage and transition to other coverage if\nthey are no longer eligible for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nFor more information regarding NY State of Health’s communications prior to the end of the PHE, visit the NY\nState of Health Important Changes Are Coming to New York Medicaid, Child Health Plus and the Essential\nPlan web page, located at: https://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/COVID-19-Changes.\nJune 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 10\n\nHelp Us Spread the Word\nAn outreach toolkit, located on the NY State of Health “Unwinding from the COVID-19 Public Health\nEmergency: A Communications Tool Kit to Keep New Yorkers Covered” web page, at:\nhttps://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/PHE-tool-kit, is available to help prepare consumers for the changes\ncoming once the PHE ends. Providers can use these regularly updated resources to help communicate with\ntheir patients enrolled in Medicaid, CHP or EP about the important steps they need to take to maintain their\nhealth coverage.\nQuestions\nFor questions or feedback, providers should email pheunwind@health.ny.gov.\n",

To view the official PHE announcement, providers can\nrefer to the HHS “Public Health Emergency Declarations” web page at: https://www.phe.gov/\nemergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx. For more information on the federal PHE wind down,\nproviders can refer to the Unwinding and Returning to Regular Operations after COVID-19 web page, located\nat: https://www.medicaid.gov/resources-for-states/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/unwinding-and-retu\nrning-regular-operations-after-covid-19/index.html.\nAs NY prepares for the transition out of the PHE, the move to resume eligibility reviews could result in a large\nnumber of beneficiaries becoming disenrolled. The NYS Department of Health (DOH) is working with partners,\nlocal districts, and other stakeholders to inform consumers about renewing their coverage and exploring other\navailable health insurance options if they no longer qualify for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nDOH’s Strategy\nFederal guidance allows States 14 months to redetermine eligibility with 60 days advanced notice. In NY, this\nmeans renewing eligibility for 8.8 million people, including:\n• 1.4 million new enrollees who have never renewed coverage with DOH, and\n• 7.4 million who have not renewed their coverage in more than two years.\nAs part of this effort, DOH will update consumer notices and eligibility and enrollment systems. Consumers\nwill be sent renewal notices describing the action needed, if any, to renew their coverage. To manage the\nvolume, consumers will maintain their regular renewal “cycles” so that approximately one out of 12 of the\npopulation will renew each month. Additional details about this timeline will be delivered when HHS\nannounces the end date of the PHE.\nCommunications\nAdditionally, a public education campaign has been initiated by NY State of Health, the state’s official\nMarketplace. The campaign will:\n• prepare Medicaid, CHP and EP enrollees for the renewal process, communicate upcoming changes\nand encourage consumers to opt into NY State of Health text messages that will alert them when it is\ntime to renew their coverage (New Yorkers can sign up for text alerts by texting START to 1-866-988-\n0327);\n• remind consumers to update their contact information to ensure renewal information from the\nMarketplace reaches them; and\n• ensure consumers take the necessary steps to renew coverage and transition to other coverage if\nthey are no longer eligible for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nFor more information regarding NY State of Health’s communications prior to the end of the PHE, visit the NY\nState of Health Important Changes Are Coming to New York Medicaid, Child Health Plus and the Essential\nPlan web page, located at: https://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/COVID-19-Changes.\nJune 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 10\n\nHelp Us Spread the Word\nAn outreach toolkit, located on the NY State of Health “Unwinding from the COVID-19 Public Health\nEmergency: A Communications Tool Kit to Keep New Yorkers Covered” web page, at:\nhttps://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/PHE-tool-kit, is available to help prepare consumers for the changes\ncoming once the PHE ends. Providers can use these regularly updated resources to help communicate with\ntheir patients enrolled in Medicaid, CHP or EP about the important steps they need to take to maintain their\nhealth coverage.\nQuestions\nFor questions or feedback, providers should email pheunwind@health.ny.gov.\n",

To view the official PHE announcement, providers can\nrefer to the HHS “Public Health Emergency Declarations” web page at: https://www.phe.gov/\nemergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx. For more information on the federal PHE wind down,\nproviders can refer to the Unwinding and Returning to Regular Operations after COVID-19 web page, located\nat: https://www.medicaid.gov/resources-for-states/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/unwinding-and-retu\nrning-regular-operations-after-covid-19/index.html.\nAs NY prepares for the transition out of the PHE, the move to resume eligibility reviews could result in a large\nnumber of beneficiaries becoming disenrolled. The NYS Department of Health (DOH) is working with partners,\nlocal districts, and other stakeholders to inform consumers about renewing their coverage and exploring other\navailable health insurance options if they no longer qualify for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nDOH’s Strategy\nFederal guidance allows States 14 months to redetermine eligibility with 60 days advanced notice. In NY, this\nmeans renewing eligibility for 8.8 million people, including:\n• 1.4 million new enrollees who have never renewed coverage with DOH, and\n• 7.4 million who have not renewed their coverage in more than two years.\nAs part of this effort, DOH will update consumer notices and eligibility and enrollment systems. Consumers\nwill be sent renewal notices describing the action needed, if any, to renew their coverage. To manage the\nvolume, consumers will maintain their regular renewal “cycles” so that approximately one out of 12 of the\npopulation will renew each month. Additional details about this timeline will be delivered when HHS\nannounces the end date of the PHE.\nCommunications\nAdditionally, a public education campaign has been initiated by NY State of Health, the state’s official\nMarketplace. The campaign will:\n• prepare Medicaid, CHP and EP enrollees for the renewal process, communicate upcoming changes\nand encourage consumers to opt into NY State of Health text messages that will alert them when it is\ntime to renew their coverage (New Yorkers can sign up for text alerts by texting START to 1-866-988-\n0327);\n• remind consumers to update their contact information to ensure renewal information from the\nMarketplace reaches them; and\n• ensure consumers take the necessary steps to renew coverage and transition to other coverage if\nthey are no longer eligible for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nFor more information regarding NY State of Health’s communications prior to the end of the PHE, visit the NY\nState of Health Important Changes Are Coming to New York Medicaid, Child Health Plus and the Essential\nPlan web page, located at: https://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/COVID-19-Changes.\nJune 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 10\n\nHelp Us Spread the Word\nAn outreach toolkit, located on the NY State of Health “Unwinding from the COVID-19 Public Health\nEmergency: A Communications Tool Kit to Keep New Yorkers Covered” web page, at:\nhttps://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/PHE-tool-kit, is available to help prepare consumers for the changes\ncoming once the PHE ends. Providers can use these regularly updated resources to help communicate with\ntheir patients enrolled in Medicaid, CHP or EP about the important steps they need to take to maintain their\nhealth coverage.\nQuestions\nFor questions or feedback, providers should email pheunwind@health.ny.gov.\n",
