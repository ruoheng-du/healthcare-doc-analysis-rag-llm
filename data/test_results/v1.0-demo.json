For additional information regarding the COVID-19 PHE,\nproviders can refer to the United States (U.S.) Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\nAdministration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) \"Declarations of a Public Health\nEmergency\" web page, located at: https://aspr.hhs.gov/legal/PHE/Pages/default.aspx. For additional\ninformation regarding resumed eligibility reviews, providers can refer to the NY State of Health Important\nChanges to New York Medicaid, Child Health Plus and the Essential Plan web page, located at:\nhttps://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/COVID-19-Changes.\nThere are approximately 8 million New Yorkers enrolled in Medicaid, CH and EP who will need to\nrenew their health insurance. It is imperative that members/enrollees are made aware of these\nchanges as they may risk losing their coverage if appropriate actions to renew are not made.\nBeginning in Spring 2023, renewal notices will be sent to members/enrollees based on their enrollment end\ndates. Renewal notices will include the deadline to take action to renew their insurance or risk having a gap\nin coverage. Deadlines will be based on the member/enrollee enrollment end dates and will range from June\n30, 2023, through May 31, 2024. During this time, NY State of Health, the Official Health Plan Marketplace\n(Marketplace), will keep enrollment open to allow consumers who are no longer eligible for Medicaid, CHP or\nEP to stay covered by enrolling in a Qualified Health Plan (QHP).\nContinued on Page 3",

The NYS Department of Health (DOH) is working with partners,\nlocal districts, and other stakeholders to inform consumers about renewing their coverage and exploring other\navailable health insurance options if they no longer qualify for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nDOH’s Strategy\nFederal guidance allows States 14 months to redetermine eligibility with 60 days advanced notice. In NY, this\nmeans renewing eligibility for 8.8 million people, including:\n• 1.4 million new enrollees who have never renewed coverage with DOH, and\n• 7.4 million who have not renewed their coverage in more than two years.\nAs part of this effort, DOH will update consumer notices and eligibility and enrollment systems. Consumers\nwill be sent renewal notices describing the action needed, if any, to renew their coverage. To manage the\nvolume, consumers will maintain their regular renewal “cycles” so that approximately one out of 12 of the\npopulation will renew each month. Additional details about this timeline will be delivered when HHS\nannounces the end date of the PHE.\nCommunications\nAdditionally, a public education campaign has been initiated by NY State of Health, the state’s official\nMarketplace. The campaign will:\n• prepare Medicaid, CHP and EP enrollees for the renewal process, communicate upcoming changes\nand encourage consumers to opt into NY State of Health text messages that will alert them when it is\ntime to renew their coverage (New Yorkers can sign up for text alerts by texting START to 1-866-988-\n0327);\n• remind consumers to update their contact information to ensure renewal information from the\nMarketplace reaches them; and\n• ensure consumers take the necessary steps to renew coverage and transition to other coverage if\nthey are no longer eligible for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nFor more information regarding NY State of Health’s communications prior to the end of the PHE, visit the NY\nState of Health Important Changes Are Coming to New York Medicaid, Child Health Plus and the Essential\nPlan web page, located at: https://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/COVID-19-Changes.\nJune 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 10\n\nHelp Us Spread the Word\nAn outreach toolkit, located on the NY State of Health “Unwinding from the COVID-19 Public Health\nEmergency: A Communications Tool Kit to Keep New Yorkers Covered” web page, at:\nhttps://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/PHE-tool-kit, is available to help prepare consumers for the changes\ncoming once the PHE ends.

        "text": "June 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 9\n\nUnwinding from the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency:\nNew York State Department of Health Shares Strategy to Help\nConsumers Maintain Coverage\nIn early 2020, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared a Public Health\nEmergency (PHE) in response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, allowing New York\n(NY) residents enrolled in Medicaid, Child Health Plus (CHP), and the Essential Plan (EP) to keep their\ncoverage without requiring an annual eligibility review. To view the official PHE announcement, providers can\nrefer to the HHS “Public Health Emergency Declarations” web page at: https://www.phe.gov/\nemergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx. For more information on the federal PHE wind down,\nproviders can refer to the Unwinding and Returning to Regular Operations after COVID-19 web page, located\nat: https://www.medicaid.gov/resources-for-states/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/unwinding-and-retu\nrning-regular-operations-after-covid-19/index.html.\nAs NY prepares for the transition out of the PHE, the move to resume eligibility reviews could result in a large\nnumber of beneficiaries becoming disenrolled. The NYS Department of Health (DOH) is working with partners,\nlocal districts, and other stakeholders to inform consumers about renewing their coverage and exploring other\navailable health insurance options if they no longer qualify for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nDOH’s Strategy\nFederal guidance allows States 14 months to redetermine eligibility with 60 days advanced notice. In NY, this\nmeans renewing eligibility for 8.8 million people, including:\n• 1.4 million new enrollees who have never renewed coverage with DOH, and\n• 7.4 million who have not renewed their coverage in more than two years.\nAs part of this effort, DOH will update consumer notices and eligibility and enrollment systems. Consumers\nwill be sent renewal notices describing the action needed, if any, to renew their coverage. To manage the\nvolume, consumers will maintain their regular renewal “cycles” so that approximately one out of 12 of the\npopulation will renew each month. Additional details about this timeline will be delivered when HHS\nannounces the end date of the PHE.\nCommunications\nAdditionally, a public education campaign has been initiated by NY State of Health, the state’s official\nMarketplace. The campaign will:\n• prepare Medicaid, CHP and EP enrollees for the renewal process, communicate upcoming changes\nand encourage consumers to opt into NY State of Health text messages that will alert them when it is\ntime to renew their coverage (New Yorkers can sign up for text alerts by texting START to 1-866-988-\n0327);\n• remind consumers to update their contact information to ensure renewal information from the\nMarketplace reaches them; and\n• ensure consumers take the necessary steps to renew coverage and transition to other coverage if\nthey are no longer eligible for Medicaid, CHP or EP.\nFor more information regarding NY State of Health’s communications prior to the end of the PHE, visit the NY\nState of Health Important Changes Are Coming to New York Medicaid, Child Health Plus and the Essential\nPlan web page, located at: https://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/COVID-19-Changes.\nJune 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 10\n\nHelp Us Spread the Word\nAn outreach toolkit, located on the NY State of Health “Unwinding from the COVID-19 Public Health\nEmergency: A Communications Tool Kit to Keep New Yorkers Covered” web page, at:\nhttps://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/PHE-tool-kit, is available to help prepare consumers for the changes\ncoming once the PHE ends. Providers can use these regularly updated resources to help communicate with\ntheir patients enrolled in Medicaid, CHP or EP about the important steps they need to take to maintain their\nhealth coverage.\nQuestions\nFor questions or feedback, providers should email pheunwind@health.ny.gov.",

This system upgrade offers an improved and more streamlined process\nfor providers interested in offering Medicaid services.\nPursuant to section 1135(b)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\nServices (CMS) has allowed states to temporarily waive and/or suspend some of the requirements for\nproviders who wish to temporarily enroll in fee-for-service (FFS) Medicaid for the purpose of assisting\nwith the COVID-19 public health emergency. As a result, and to expedite and simplify the enrollment\nprocess, the Department of Health’s Bureau of Provider Enrollment has taken action to implement\nthe following:\n(i) Create an online Provisional Temporary Provider Enrollment application process that\nallows physicians, registered physician assistants (RPAs), nurse practitioners (NPs),\nregistered nurses (RNs), and licensed practical nurses (LPNs) to enroll on a temporary basis\nfor the purpose of assisting with COVID-19 activities;\n(ii) Allow a retroactive effective date no earlier than March 1, 2020, for Provisional Temporary\nProvider Enrollments;\n(iii) Waive application fees for Provisional Temporary Provider Enrollment applications;\n(iv) Waive the screening requirements of site visits and fingerprint-based Criminal Background\nChecks for Provisional Temporary Provider Enrollments;\n(v) Allow providers who are enrolled in either Medicare or another state’s Medicaid program to\nenroll in NY Medicaid as Provisional Temporary providers;\n(vi) Allow providers who are licensed outside of New York State to render services to Medicaid\nmembers during the public health emergency as Provisional Temporary providers;\n(vii) Allow credentialing offices to submit multiple provider enrollments using a spreadsheet,\nprovided by eMedNY; and\n(viii) Enroll providers who are not enrolled in Medicare or another state’s Medicaid program if the\nrequested data is provided on the Provisional Temporary Provider Enrollment application and\nthe provider: 1) is not currently excluded from NYS Medicaid; 2) does not appear on the Office\nof Inspector General (OIG) Exclusions Database; and 3) is licensed and legally authorized to\npractice or deliver the service for which they file claims in at least one state or territory.\nContinued on page 3\n\nAndrew M.

Providers must not require a new patient to complete prerequisites to schedule an\nappointment, such as:\n• a copy of their medical record;\n• a health screening questionnaire; and/or\n• an immunization record.\nThe provider may request additional information from the new Medicaid member, if the appointment is scheduled\nat the time of the telephone request. The Department considers prerequisites to scheduling appointments as\nbarriers in gaining access to health care services. Medicaid PCPs are advised to contact the MMC Plan if they\nare having difficulty meeting the above appointment and availability standards.\nQuestions may be sent to the Office of Health Insurance Programs (OHIP), Division of Health Plan Contracting\nand Oversight, Bureau of Managed Care Certification and Surveillance at: BMCCSmail@health.ny.gov.",

        "text": "December 2020\nVolume 36 | Number 17\nMedicaid Pharmacy Carve-Out\nSpecial Edition – Part One\nThis publication provides information regarding the Medicaid Pharmacy Carve-Out, a Medicaid Redesign\nTeam (MRT) II initiative to transition the pharmacy benefit from managed care to the Medicaid Fee-for-Service\n(FFS) Pharmacy Program. It contains general information regarding New York State’s (NYS) transition\nstrategy and other important facts that will assist providers in transitioning members to the FFS Pharmacy\nProgram. Future Medicaid Update articles will provide additional details and guidance. More detailed\ninformation is available and regularly updated on the Pharmacy Carve-Out web page.\nGeneral Information\nEffective April 1, 2021, Medicaid members enrolled in mainstream Managed Care (MC) plans, Health and\nRecovery Plans (HARPs), and HIV-Special Needs Plan (SNPs) will receive their pharmacy benefits through\nthe Medicaid FFS Pharmacy Program instead of through their Medicaid MC plan as they do now. The\nPharmacy Carve-Out does not apply to members enrolled in Managed Long-Term Care plans (e.g., MLTC,\nPACE and MAP), the Essential Plan, or Child Health Plus (CHP). Transitioning the pharmacy benefit from\nMC to FFS will provide the State with full visibility into prescription drug costs, allow centralization of the\nbenefit, leverage negotiation power, and provide a single drug formulary with standardized utilization\nmanagement protocols simplifying and streamlining the drug benefit for Medicaid members.\nScope of Benefits\nThe FFS Pharmacy Carve-Out will not change the scope (e.g. copayments, covered drugs, etc.) of the\nexisting Medicaid Pharmacy benefit, which includes:\n• Covered outpatient prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs that are listed on the Medicaid\nPharmacy List of Reimbursable Drugs;\n• Pharmacist administered vaccines and supplies listed in the Pharmacy Procedures and Supply Codes\ndocument, such as enteral and parenteral nutrition, family planning, and medical/surgical supplies.\nThe complete list of items subject to the Pharmacy Benefit Carve-Out can be reviewed in the Carve-Out\nScope web page. Please Note: Physician administered (J-Code) drugs that are not listed on the Medicaid\nPharmacy List of Reimbursable Drugs and durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies\n(DMEPOS) as listed in sections 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7 of the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics and\nSupplies Manual are not subject to the carve-out.

Additional challenges include:\n• managing the comorbidities associated with SCD,\n• understanding pain and pain control/management issues,\n• recognizing self-care and self-efficacy,\n• acknowledging and addressing social determinants of health,\n• connecting to community support services (such as peer supports) and appropriate educational\ninformation.\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• Questions should be directed to the Health Home program at healthhomes@health.ny.gov.\n• For information regarding the implementation of the NYS Medicaid Health Home program, providers\ncan refer to the April 2012 Special Edition Medicaid Update titled Introducing Health Homes Improving\nCare for Medicaid Recipients with Chronic Conditions, available at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2012/april12muspec.pdf.",

The RRP may\nrestrict the recipient to care provided by a PCP, inpatient hospital, and/or primary pharmacy.\nAdditional information regarding the RRP can be found on the NYS OMIG “About the Recipient Restriction\nProgram (RRP)” web page, located at: https://omig.ny.gov/information-resources/about-recipient-restriction-\nprogram-rrp.",

It is required that children in foster care are up to three\nyears of age have their mouths examined at such medical examination and, where appropriate, referred for\ndental care. Children in foster care over the age of three are required to see a dentist at minimum, once a\nyear, and must be provided dental care when needed.\nChildren may enter foster care having never seen a dentist. It is critical that these children receive expedited\naccess to care.

Providers must consider making an extra effort to accommodate these children into their\ndental practice by ensuring availability of appointments. As a reminder, the cost of analgesic and anesthetic\nagents, including nitrous oxide, is included in the reimbursement for dental services under the NYS Medicaid\ndental policy, which is available in the eMedNY New York State Medicaid Program Dental Policy and\nProcedure Code Manual, located at: https://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/Dental/PDFS/Dental_\nPolicy_and_Procedure_Manual.pdf. By enrolling in the NYS Medicaid program, providers have agreed to\nprovide this service when medically necessary as part of the dental procedure. MMC Plans are also required\nto cover nitrous oxide when medically necessary; reimbursement for nitrous oxide is determined by the terms\nof the contract between the provider and the plan and may be included in rates for service or separate.\nProviders should check the terms of their contracts with the MMC Plans they participate with on appropriate\nbilling for analgesic and anesthetic agents.\nJune 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 7\n\nFoster parents should never be charged for services that are already covered. For additional information,\nproviders can refer to the Medicaid Beneficiaries Cannot be Billed article, published in the February 2014\nissue of the Medicaid Update, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/\nupdate/2014/feb14_mu.pdf.\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• Fee-for-service (FFS) claim questions should be directed to the eMedNY Call Center at (800) 343-\n9000.\n• FFS coverage and policy questions should be directed to the Office of Health Insurance Programs\n(OHIP) Division of Program Development and Management (DPDM) by telephone at (518) 473-2160\nor by email at FFSMedicaidPolicy@health.ny.gov.\n• MMC reimbursement, billing, and/or documentation requirement questions should be directed to the\nenrollee’s MMC Plan.\n• MMC Plan contact information can be found in the eMedNY New York State Medicaid Program\nInformation for All Providers Managed Care Information document, located at:\nhttps://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/AllProviders/PDFS/Information_for_All_Providers_Manag\ned_Care_Information.pdf.",

        "text": "January 2021\nVolume 37 | Number 1\nImportant Information for All Providers Serving Children\nEffective July 1, 2021, as part of the New York State overall redesign of children’s healthcare and behavioral\nhealth systems, Medicaid-covered children/youth in foster care will be enrolled in Medicaid Managed Care\nPlans (MMCP) unless they are otherwise excluded or exempt from mandatory Medicaid managed care. The\nMedicaid-covered children/youth in foster care can either be in the care of Voluntary Foster Care Agencies\n(VFCAs) or be in foster homes certified by Local Departments of Social Services (LDSS) statewide. Their\nenrollment in MMCP can include Mainstream MMCP and HIV Special Needs Plans (HIV-SNP).\nBeginning in February 2021, the State will license qualified VFCAs pursuant to Article 29-I of the New York\nState Public Health Law (visit: http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/lawssrch.cgi?NVLWO: for Laws of New York,\nthen select “PBH” for Public Health, then navigate to Article 29-I) to deliver a limited set of health-related\nservices to children/youth in their care. In accordance with the 29-I Health Facility Billing Guidance, Medicaid\nwill cover health and behavioral health services provided to eligible children/youth by licensed 29-I Health\nFacilities. Effective July 1, 2021, MMC Plans will begin covering 29-I Health Facility services for their\neligible members.\nEffective February 1, 2021, the Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) Program will update the Medicaid Foster\nCare Drug Carve-Out List with additional drug(s)/drug classes and products listed on the Preferred Diabetic\nSupply Program. VFCAs will continue to cover the cost of drugs/products that are not included on the Foster\nCare Drug Carve-Out list until June 30, 2021. Effective July 1, 2021, all pharmacy benefits for this\npopulation will be paid for under Medicaid FFS.\nAll providers who deliver services to children/youth in foster care or to children/youth in the care of VFCAs\nshould be aware of this transition. Effective July 1, 2021, VFCAs will no longer be the payor for Medicaid\ncovered services delivered to children/youth in their care, and community providers serving these children will\ndirect claims to the child/youth’s MMCP or the Medicaid FFS, as applicable. To avoid disruption in services\nto children/youth during this transition, providers traditionally serving this population are strongly encouraged\nto enroll in the NYS Medicaid program then engage with MMCP in their area to ensure continued coverage\nfor their patients.\nPolicy requirements for this transition, including continuity of care requirements for transitioning children/youth\nenrolling in Medicaid managed care, 29-I Health Facility rate information, and 29-I Health Facility services\nguidelines, can be located on the Department of Health’s 29-I Health Facility (VFCA Transition) web page.\nQuestions\nAll questions may be directed to BH.transition@health.ny.gov.",

Providers who demonstrate\nMeaningful Use (MU) of their EHR systems are leading the way towards interoperability, which is the ability of\nhealthcare providers to exchange and use patient health records electronically. The ultimate goal is to increase\npatient involvement, reduce costs, and improve health outcomes.\nHow does using EHR promote interoperability?\n• Providers are ensuring that Protected Health Information (PHI) is private, secure, and easily useable by\nthe patient, their family, and by other providers - current and future;\n• There is full and easy access to all electronic health information that is authorized for such; and\n• There is protection against information blocking – when a provider, vendor, or information technology (IT)\ndeveloper knowingly and unreasonably interferes with the exchange and use of electronic health\ninformation. Examples of information blocking include: fees that make data exchange cost prohibitive;\norganizational policies that prohibit the exchange of information; or when patients or health care providers\nbecome “locked in” to a specific technology or health care network because data are not portable.\nImportant Note:\nAll EPs attesting to Payment Year (PY) 2019 Stage 3 MU must use 2015 Certified Electronic Health Record\nTechnology (CEHRT).\nRegister in MURPH: Stage 3 Objective 8 (Public Health)\nEPs must register their intent to submit data to the appropriate Public Health registries before or within 60 days\nfrom the start of their EHR Reporting Period.
