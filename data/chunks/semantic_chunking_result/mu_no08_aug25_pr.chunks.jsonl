Some of these Medicare Advantage Plans have been using a pre-paid debit card as the\nannual dental benefit that the NYS Medicaid member can use to pay for dental services. These pre-paid debit cards can be considered private pay agreements with the provider until they are\nexhausted (the term private pay is being used in this instance “only for billing purposes” and under no\ncircumstances does it reflect the out-of-pocket expenses by NYS Medicaid members). The fee that the\nprovider charges for their service while using the pre-paid debit card is not subject to NYS Medicaid allowable\namounts. Once the funds on the debit card have been exhausted, the provider may bill NYS Medicaid,\nprovided that the NYS Medicaid member is eligible on the date of service. The provider must abide by NYS\nMedicaid allowable amounts for these services. If a balance remains on the debit card that does not fully\ncover the dental service provided and NYS Medicaid is secondary coverage for the NYS Medicaid member,\nthe provider should report the balance remaining from the debit card on the NYS Medicaid claim in the “Patient\nPaid Amount” field. Providers must keep records to identify that the payment was made by the pre-paid debit card and not cash,\nif the dental service provided is a NYS Medicaid-covered service.", "chunk_type": "text"}
