These files are the X12/005010X221 835 Health Care Claim\nPayment Advice (835), Pended Claims Report (835S), X12/005010X218 Premium Payment Advice (820), and\nthe Managed Care Capitation Premium Pended and Denied Claims Report (820S). File naming conventions for\nremits and all other file types can be found in section 7.1.1 of the eMedNY Trading Partner Information\nCompanion Guide found under the eMedNY HIPAA Support section of the eMedNY website at:\nwww.emedny.org.\nFrequently asked questions (FAQ) related to TAR files:\nQ. What does TAR stand for?\nA. TAR stands for Tape Archive and is a time-tested way for many files to be concatenated into a single file that\nis easier to download, transmit, and/or backup. While somewhat similar to the functionality of the popular Zip file\nformat, TAR performs no compression to the file on its own. TAR minimizes the number of potential downloads\neXchange users need to perform. Users receive the same number of files but with a manageable number of\ndownloads.\nQ. How does a provider extract the remittances from a TAR file?\nA. Windows does not natively support TAR files; however, many third-party applications exist that will open,\nextract, and even create TAR files. Most applications that handle Zip files on Windows are designed to support\nTAR files as well. Contact your information technology (IT) support to select the right program for your working\nenvironment.\nQ. Is there assistance available to walk providers through extracting remittances?\nA. Because of the heterogeneous nature of platforms in the eMedNY provider community, support staff cannot\noffer per-user support for extracting remittances from TAR files. The online resources are sufficient for a vast\nmajority of users and when in doubt", "chunk_type": "text"}
