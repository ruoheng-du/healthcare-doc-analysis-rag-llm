Compliance with the requirements of SOS §363-d is a condition\nof payment of the medical assistance program.\nAll providers who are subject to the mandatory compliance program requirements in SOS §363-d will\nbe impacted by these changes and should take the steps necessary to review the changes, then\ncomply.\nIt is the provider’s responsibility to ascertain whether or not they are required to implement and operate an\neffective compliance program under the statute [see SOS §363-d(4)]. Providers subject to the provisions of\nthis section include those for which the medical assistance program is a substantial portion of their business\noperations. “Substantial portion of business operations” is defined in 18 New York Consolidated Rules and\nRegulations (NYCRR) Part 521. The Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG) will issue updated\nguidance in the coming months.\nOMIG monitors providers' adherence to the requirements found in SOS §363-d and Part 521. Providers are\nadvised to review the amendments made to SOS §363-d, in Part QQ of Chapter 56 of the Laws of 2020 which\ncan be found at: https://omig.ny.gov/compliance/compliance-library. In the interim, providers subject to the\nmandatory compliance program requirements must continue to maintain and operate their compliance\nprograms.\nQuestions regarding the information presented in this article should be directed to OMIG’s Bureau of\nCompliance at (518) 408-0401 or via email at compliance@omig.ny.gov.\n****************************************************************************************************************\n\nAndrew M.

Beginning on this date, providers who have met\nthe attestation criteria will be able to complete their attestations in Medicaid EHR Incentive Program\nAdministrative Support Service (MEIPASS).

A Pre-Validation allows providers to submit their patient volume data for review and approval\nahead of attestation and can allow the EPs to advance through the review process more quickly once\nMEIPASS begins accepting attestations.\nPre-Validations for PY 2020 will be accepted from September 14, 2020 through December 14, 2020. If\nproviders would like to take advantage of this service and avoid patient volume remediation during the official\nor soft opening attestation periods, they must begin the process of finding a suitable Medicaid patient volume\nreporting period.\nTo submit a Pre-Validation, simply select your Patient Volume Reporting period and fill out the appropriate\nPre-Validation form with the data for that period.
