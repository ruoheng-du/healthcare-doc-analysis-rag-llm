Transitioning the pharmacy benefit from MMC to NYRx will\nprovide NYS with full visibility into prescription drug costs, allow centralization of the benefit, leverage\nnegotiation power, and provide a uniform list of covered drugs with standardized utilization management\nprotocols simplifying and streamlining the drug benefit for NYS Medicaid members.
