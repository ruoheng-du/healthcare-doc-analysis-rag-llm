The vaccines are distributed to private physicians' offices, pharmacies, and public health clinics\nenrolled as VFC providers. VFC providers administer the vaccines to VFC-eligible children. A child is eligible for\nVFC vaccine if he or she is younger than 19 years of age and Medicaid-enrolled, which includes both fee-for-\nservice (FFS) and Medicaid Managed Care (MMC).\nNote: The VFC program is currently enrolling pharmacies to receive influenza vaccine only. Pharmacies\nimmunizing patients 18 years of age with pneumococcal, meningococcal, tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis\nvaccines may not bill Medicaid for the costs of these vaccines. Patients 18 years of age who are enrolled in\nMedicaid are VFC-eligible and may receive these vaccines through a VFC healthcare practice or clinic.\nNew York State (NYS) Medicaid should never be billed for the cost of any vaccine for persons under 19 years\nof age when it is available through the VFC Program. This applies to both FFS and MMC.

The New\nYork State Department of Health (the Department) has now determined that the current capabilities of the prior\nauthorization and claims payment systems can accommodate fractional mileage claims that reflect distance to\nthe nearest tenth of a mile. The submission of fractional mileage claims will enhance payment accuracy, reduce\nMedicaid overpayments, achieve alignment with current Medicare mileage reimbursement policy, and better\nreflect the advent of geocoded trip recording technologies.\nEffective for dates of service on or after August 1, 2019, claims for loaded mileage must be reported as\nfractional units to the tenth of a mile (for trips totaling less than one mile, enter a “0” before the decimal point\n(e.g. 0.9). Rounding mileage units up to the nearest whole number is not allowed for claims with dates of service\non or after August 1, 2019. Rounded-up claims may be deemed fraudulent and therefore subject to any\nrecoveries and associated penalties by enforcement agencies.
