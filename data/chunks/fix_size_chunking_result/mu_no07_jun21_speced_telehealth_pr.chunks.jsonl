General Information\nEffective for dates of service on or after March 1, 2020, for the duration of the federally declared PHE,\nNYS Medicaid will reimburse telephonic assessment, monitoring, and Evaluation and Management (E&M)\nservices provided to members in cases where face-to-face visits may not be recommended and it is\nappropriate for the member to be evaluated and managed by telephone. This guidance supports the policy\nthat members should be treated through telehealth provided by all Medicaid qualified practitioners and service\nproviders, including telephonically, wherever possible to avoid member congregation with potentially sick\npatients. Telephonic communication will be covered when provided by any qualified practitioner or service\nprovider. All telephonic encounters documented as appropriate by the provider would be considered medically\nnecessary for payment purposes in Medicaid FFS or MMC. All other requirements in delivery of these services\notherwise apply.\nThe following information applies to all Medicaid providers and providers contracted to serve Medicaid\nmembers under MMC Plans.

Lanes 1 and 2 are for use by fee schedule billers (primarily practitioners in office-based settings). Lanes 3 through 6 are\nfor all other billers that primarily bill rates for clinic and other services. Practitioners that usually bill the fee schedule directly should bill for telephonic services\nusing Lanes 1 and 2 based on practitioner types noted. Clinics should bill using Lanes 3 through 5 depending on FQHC status and practitioner type. Lane\n5 is for clinics, non-licensed practitioners and FQHCs to use for the noted practitioners and should be used for any and all patient assessment and\nmanagement services that are appropriate to be billed telephonically unless otherwise noted. Lane 6 is reserved for all other services that do not fit into the\nfirst five lanes. More guidance will be issued on Lane 6 adding to the noted services, but it is expected that over 90 percent of all Medicaid telephonic billing\nshould fall into Lanes 1 through 5.\n\nIII. Telehealth\nA. Definition of Telehealth\nTelehealth is defined as the use of electronic information and communication technologies to deliver health\ncare to patients at a distance. Medicaid covered services provided via telehealth include assessment,\ndiagnosis, consultation, treatment, education, care management and/or self-management of a Medicaid\nmember. For purposes of the PHE, this definition is expanded to include audio-only conversations.

For purposes of the PHE, this definition is expanded to include audio-only conversations. Therefore,\nduring the PHE, telehealth includes telephonic, telemedicine, store and forward, and remote patient\nmonitoring. Telemedicine is the term used in this guidance to denote two-way audiovisual communication.\nDuring the PHE, all telehealth applications will be covered at all originating and distant sites as appropriate to\nproperly care for the patient.\nB. Originating Site\nThe originating site is where the member is located at the time health care services are delivered to him/her\nby means of telehealth. Originating sites during the PHE can be anywhere the member is located including\nthe member’s home. There are no limits on originating sites during the PHE.\nC. Distant Site\nThe distant site is the site where the telehealth provider is located while delivering health care services by\nmeans of telehealth. During the PHE, any site within the fifty United States (US) or US’ territories, is eligible\nto be a distant site for delivery and payment purposes, including FQHCs and providers’ homes, for all patients\nincluding patients dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare.\nD. Telemedicine\nTelemedicine uses two-way electronic audio-visual communications to deliver clinical health care services to\na patient at an originating site by a telehealth provider located at a distant site. Telemedicine includes\nteledentistry.\nE. Store-and-Forward Technology\nStore-and-forward technology involves the asynchronous, electronic transmission of a member's health\ninformation in the form of patient-specific pre-recorded videos and/or digital images from a provider at an\noriginating site to a telehealth provider at a distant site.\n1. Store-and-forward technology aids in diagnoses when live video or face-to-face contact is not readily\navailable or not necessary or in the case of the PHE is imprudent.\n2.

Store-and-forward technology aids in diagnoses when live video or face-to-face contact is not readily\navailable or not necessary or in the case of the PHE is imprudent.\n2. Pre-recorded videos and/or static digital images (e.g., pictures), excluding radiology, must be specific\nto the member's condition as well as be adequate for rendering or confirming a diagnosis or a plan of\ntreatment.\nF. Remote Patient Monitoring\nRemote patient monitoring (RPM) uses digital technologies to collect medical data and other personal health\ninformation from members in one location and electronically transmit that information to health care providers\nin a different location for assessment and recommendations. Monitoring programs can collect a wide range\nof health data from the point of care, such as vital signs, blood pressure, heart rate, weight, blood sugar, blood\noxygen levels and electrocardiogram readings. RPM may include follow-up on previously transmitted data\nconducted through communication technologies or by telephone.\nMedical conditions that may be treated/monitored by means of RPM include, but are not limited to, congestive\nheart failure, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, wound care, polypharmacy, mental or\nbehavioral problems, and technology-dependent care such as continuous oxygen, ventilator care, total\nparenteral nutrition or enteral feeding.\nJune 2021 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 7\n\nG. Telephonic (Audio-only)\nTelephonic service uses two-way electronic audio-only communications to deliver services to a patient at an\noriginating site by a telehealth provider located at a distant site.

Telehealth Providers\nDuring the PHE any provider, who is authorized to deliver Medicaid billable services, including Article 29-I\nHealth Facilities, is eligible to provide services via telehealth, but services shall be appropriate for telehealth\nand shall be within the provider’s scope of practice.\nV. Confidentiality\nServices provided by means of telehealth must be in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act (HIPAA) and all other relevant laws and regulations governing confidentiality, privacy, and\nconsent (including, but not limited to 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164 [HIPAA Security Rules]; 42 CFR, Part 2; PHL\nArticle 27-F; and MHL Section 33.13). However, during the COVID-19 federally declared PHE, the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has issued a Notification of\nEnforcement Discretion for telehealth remote communications at: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-\nprofessionals/special-topics/emergency-preparedness/notification-enforcement-discretion-\ntelehealth/index.html. OCR will exercise its enforcement discretion and will not impose penalties for\nnoncompliance with the regulatory requirements under the HIPAA Rules against covered health care\nproviders in connection with the good faith provision of telehealth during the emergency.\nAll providers must take steps to reasonably ensure privacy during all patient-practitioner interactions.\nVI. Patient Rights and Consents\nThe practitioner shall confirm the member’s identity and provide the member with basic information about the\nservices that he/she will be receiving via telehealth.

Absent existing state mandated rates or negotiated rates for telehealth/telephonic services, MMC\nPlans must reimburse network providers at the same rate that would be reimbursed for providing the\nsame service via a face-to-face encounter.\n3. MMC Plans may not limit member access to telehealth/telephonic services to solely the MMC Plans\ntelehealth vendors and must cover appropriate telehealth/telephonic services provided by other\nnetwork providers.\n4.
