Individuals with income\nup to, and including, 138 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), will be eligible for the Qualified Medicare\nBeneficiary (QMB) category of the MSP. Due to this change, more individuals qualify for this benefit. Eligibility\nresponses for these individuals, in the Electronic Provider Assisted Claim Entry System (ePACES), will\nindicate active Medicare and include “QMB” as a suffix to the type of Medicare in which the individuals are\nenrolled:\nThere are no changes to the billing process for NYS Medicaid members enrolled in MSP at the QMB level.\nAdditionally, effective January 1, 2023, the Medicaid Medically Needy Income Level (MNIL) has\nincreased to 138 percent of the FPL. As a result, the MNIL for a single individual has increased from $934\nto $1,563, and from $1,367 to $2,106 for a couple.
