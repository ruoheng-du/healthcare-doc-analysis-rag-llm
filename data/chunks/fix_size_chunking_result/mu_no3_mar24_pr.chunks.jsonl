The\ninstitutionalized spouse is considered medically needy if their resources are at or below a certain level and\nthe monthly income after certain deductions is less than the cost of care in the facility. Federal and State laws\nrequire that spousal impoverishment rules be used to determine an institutionalized spouse’s eligibility for\nMedicaid. These rules protect some of the income and resources of the couple for the community spouse.\nPlease note: Spousal impoverishment rules do not apply to an institutionalized spouse who is eligible under\nthe Modified Adjusted Gross Income rules.\nIf you or your spouse are:\n1. In a medical institution or nursing facility and are likely to remain there for at least 30 consecutive days;\nor\n2. Receiving home and community-based services provided pursuant to a waiver under §1915(c) of the\nfederal Social Security Act and are likely to receive such services for at least 30 consecutive days; or\n3.
