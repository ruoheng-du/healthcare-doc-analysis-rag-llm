These\nchanges are meant to promote the use of safe, effective, and medically necessary Food and Drug\nAdministration-approved non-prescription drugs for NYRx members. During the February 2025 Drug\nUtilization Review (DUR) Board Meeting, the DUR Board reviewed and approved coverage changes listed\nbelow.\nEffective August 1, 2025, NYRx will remove the following products from the New York State Department of\nHealth List of Medicaid Reimbursable Drugs, located on the eMedNY “Medicaid Pharmacy List of\nReimbursable Drugs” web page at: https://www.emedny.org/info/formfile.aspx:\n• Gastrointestinal Products: Bismuth subsalicylate\n• Otic Products: Carbamide peroxide\n• Topical Products: Menthol-containing products\nImpact on Providers and Patients:\n• Transition to Alternative Therapies: Providers are encouraged to discuss these changes with their\npatients.
