A member, also known as a client, recipient, or enrollee, must present an official\nCommon Benefit Identification Card (CBIC) to the provider when requesting services. As the issuance of a\nCBIC does not constitute full authorization for provision of medical services and supplies, the member\neligibility must also be verified through eMedNY to confirm the member's subsequent eligibility for services\nand supplies. A provider that does not verify eligibility prior to provision of services will risk\nnonpayment for those services. A provider uses the following methods to access the verification process\nthrough eMedNY:\n• Telephone verification method: Audio Response Unit (ARU)\n• Other access methods:\no Electronic Provider Assisted Claim Entry System (ePACES)\no Central Processing Unit (CPU): CPU-to-CPU link\no eMedNY eXchange\no File Transfer Service using Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)\no CORE (Committee on Operating Rules for Information Exchange compliant) Web Services\nInformation regarding MEVS access methods and links to those listed above can be found within eMedNY’s\nNew York State Medicaid: Medicaid Eligibility Verification System (MEVS) Methods document at:\nhttps://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/5010/MEVS%20Quick%20Reference%20Guides/5010_MEVS_M\nethods.pdf.\nMEVS/DVS Provider Manual\nThe MEVS/DVS Provider Manual, located on the eMedNY website at:\nhttps://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/5010/MEVS/MEVS_DVS_Provider_Manual_(5010).pdf, is a\nvaluable resource to assist providers in interpreting the MEVS message providers encounter when checking\neligibility.
