The pharmacy benefit transition to NYRx does not apply to NYS Medicaid\nmembers enrolled in Managed Long-Term Care (MLTC) Plans [e.g., MLTC, Programs of All-Inclusive Care\nfor the Elderly (PACE), Medicaid Advantage Plus (MAP)], the Essential Plan (EP), or Child Health Plus (CHP).\nTransitioning the pharmacy benefit from MMC to NYRx will provide NYS with full visibility into prescription\ndrug costs, allow centralization of the benefit, leverage negotiating power, and provide a uniform list of\ncovered drugs with standardized utilization management protocols simplifying and streamlining the drug\nbenefit for NYS Medicaid members and MMC enrollees. NYS Medicaid members have comprehensive drug\ncoverage and equitable access to an extensive network of over 5,000 pharmacy providers. This guidance\nprovides information in addition to what was provided in the October 2022 NYRx Pharmacy Benefit Transition\n– Part One Special Edition issue of the Medicaid Update, located at: https://www. health.ny.gov/\nhealth_care/medicaid/program/update/2022/docs/mu_no11_oct22_speced.pdf.\nInformation for Pharmacies\nEffective April 1, 2023, pharmacies will need to bill NYRx using the Client Identification Number (CIN), which\ncan be found on the NYS Medicaid Common Benefit Identification Card (CBIC) and on the MMC card of the\nenrollee. Each MMC Plan will implement point-of-service claim denial messaging that directs pharmacies to\nbill NYRx where applicable. In a future update, NYS Department of Health (DOH) will provide the claim denial\nmessaging that will be used by MMC Plans, starting April 1, 2023.\nContinued on Page 3\n"}

As a result of this\nanalysis, NYS DOH has added certain PADs to the NYRx formulary. Please note: PADs dispensed as a\nPharmacy Benefit must be delivered by the pharmacy directly to the site of administration. Additional\ninformation regarding pharmacy dispensing of PADs and delivery requirements can be found in the NYRx,\nThe NY Medicaid Pharmacy Program – Pharmacy Manual Policy Guidelines, located at:\nhttps://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/Pharmacy/PDFS/Pharmacy_Policy_Guidelines.pdf, under the\nfollowing sections: “Pharmacy Dispensing of Drugs That Require Administration by a Practitioner” and\n“Delivery”.
