This virus causes a disease called COVID-19 and can lead to fever, cough and\nshortness of breath. There are thousands of confirmed cases in a growing number of countries\ninternationally and the virus is now spreading in the United States. Investigations are ongoing to learn\nmore about this virus.\nThis guidance is effective immediately and shall remain in effect for the remainder of the disaster\nemergency declared by Executive Order No. 202, or until the issuance of subsequent guidance by the\nNYSDOH prior to the expiration of such state disaster emergency declaration.\nThe New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) is coordinating with federal and local partners to\nrespond to COVID-19 as information becomes available. Reported illnesses have ranged from mild\nrespiratory symptoms, similar to a cold, to severe illness, resulting in pneumonia and even death.\nProviders should have an emergency preparedness plan in place for their facilities. The latest NYS-\nspecific information can be found on the NYSDOH website at the following link:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/coronavirus/.\nThe latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance for healthcare professionals is\navailable at the following link: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/index.html.\nTreatment\nCurrently there is no available antiviral to treat COVID-19, though some international clinical trials are\nunderway.\nVaccine\nAt this point there is not a vaccine for COVID-19. If a vaccine is developed, this guidance document will\nbe updated.\nTesting of Persons Under Investigation (PUI)\nCurrently COVID-19 tests are being conducted at the CDC, the NYS Wadsworth Center, and the New\nYork City Public Health Laboratory. Tests performed for suspected individuals at these current public\nhealth sites are provided at no cost. Additionally, some hospitals and commercial laboratories are now\nauthorized to perform COVID-19 testing.\nContinued on Page 3\n\nWhen a test is ordered and referred to a public health lab, it is critical that the order form included with\nthe test sample is legible and completed in its entirety.\nContinued on Page 3\n\nAndrew M.

Providers should follow CDC coding guidelines\nbelow when submitting claims to Medicaid.\nCoding\nNYS Medicaid will add Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes as they become\navailable. In February 2020, CMS developed the first HCPCS code (“U0001”) to bill for tests and track\nnew cases of the virus. This code is used specifically for CDC testing laboratories to test patients for\nCOVID-19. The second HCPCS billing code (“U0002”) allows laboratories to bill for non-CDC laboratory\ntests for COVID-19. There is now a third code for billing tests for COVID-19, “87635”, released by the\nAmerican Medical Association (AMA) on March 13, 2020. This code has been adopted by some\ncommercial laboratories enrolled in NYS Medicaid. Laboratories should follow CMS guid"}
