This update is designed to promote effective\ntesting habits to support individuals managing their diabetes. Changes to the supply limits for test strips and lancets and the implications for pharmacies\nand healthcare providers, are explained below.\nOverview of the New NYS Medicaid Policy\nEffective October 1, 2024, the NYS Medicaid blood glucose testing supply coverage will align with Medicare policies. The new guidelines are as follows:\n• NYS Medicaid members using insulin: Individuals requiring insulin for blood glucose management will be eligible to receive up to 300 test strips\nand 300 lancets every three months.\n• NYS Medicaid members not using insulin: Individuals managing their diabetes without insulin will be eligible for an allowance up to 100 test strips and 100\nlancets every three months.\nWhy This Change Matters\nSimplifying Access: Aligning NYS Medicaid policies with the latest clinical guidelines simplifies the process for both pharmacies and physicians,\nensuring that beneficiaries receive the supplies they need without unnecessary hurdles.\nPharmacies and Practitioners:\nKey Actions: To facilitate a smooth transition to the updated policy, NYRx recommends the following actions for pharmacies and health care providers:\n• Educate Patients: Patients with diabetes should be informed about their current testing habits. Pharmacy personnel and health care providers should\ntake the initiative to communicate these changes during patient interactions.\n• Promote Effective Monitoring: For patients not currently on an adequate testing regimen, pharmacy personnel and health care providers\nshould encourage establishing a regular routine for blood glucose monitoring, emphasizing the importance of being proactive in managing\ntheir condition.\n• Understand Claims Processing Limitations: NYRx edit “00710” (Procedure/Formulary Code Exceeds Service Limits)\nlocated on the NYRx, the Medicaid Pharmacy Program: Top Edit Resource, will be triggered for claims exceeding the above\nfrequency limitations. Providers should verify the prescription directions for use and consult the prescriber, as necessary, on any\nchanges. Frequency/Quantity/Duration amounts over the current criteria may be considered on a case-by-case basis\nfor limited durations. An example of a medical exception to this limitation could be a patient with a diagnosis of gestational diabetes requiring more\nfrequent monitoring for a period of time.\nTo view reminders, providers should refer to the Blood Glucose Testing and Monitoring Changes article this month's issue.\nQuestions and Additonal Information:\n• Additional information regarding the new policy changes can be found on the NYRx Preferred Diabetic Supply Program Resource.\n• Providers should refer to the CMS Medicare Coverage Database (MCD) Glucose Monitor - Policy Article.\n• NYRx coverage and policy questions should be directed to the Medicaid Pharmacy Unit by telephone at (518) 486-3209 or by email at NYRx@\nhealth.ny.gov.\n• Billing and claims processing questions should be directed to the eMedNY Call Center at (800) 343-9000.\nBack to Top\nUpcoming Changes to Billing Requirements for Professional Drug Claims\nEffective October 1, 2024, in preparation for changes per the 2024-25 enacted budget for the reimbursement of practitioner administered drugs (PADs),\nthe New York State (NYS) Department of Health (DOH) will only pend claims for manual pricing “BR” (By report) for unlisted drug codes.

When required to revalidate, notification will always be mailed to the correspondence address of the provider\nthat is on file, providing sufficient time to act. Therefore, providers are asked NOT to submit a revalidation package until notified to do so, as this\ncan cause confusion and delays in processing all application types.\nOnce a revalidation has been submitted, eMedNY or NYS Department of Health (DOH) will contact the provider if more information is\nneeded. Otherwise, nothing more is needed from the provider. Upon successful processing of the revalidation, the provider will\nbe sent notification of such.

The Medication Synchronization program is designed to streamline\nthe medication management process for NYS Medicaid members. Medication synchronization is intended to improve adherence to medication\nregimens by aligning prescription refills, so that maintenance medications and non-controlled substances are filled on the same day each month.\nMedication Synchronization Program Overview\nThe Medication Synchronization program allows for the synchronization of multiple prescriptions, enabling patients to pick up their medications on a single\nday each month. This is particularly beneficial for patients who manage multiple conditions, reducing the number of trips to the pharmacy and improving\nadherence. Pharmacy providers should work with practitioners and patients to determine an effective begin date, to minimize excess supply.\nTo view eligibility, providers should refer to the Medication Synchronization Program Implementation article in this month's issue.\nTo view claim submission information, providers should refer to this month's issue.\nLimitation\nAll NYS Medicaid beneficiaries are eligible for one synchronization of a specific maintenance medication, per calendar year.

This benefit applies, but is not\nlimited to, medications prescribed to treat hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol, depression, mild pain, asthma, and chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease (COPD).\nNinety-day supplies offer numerous benefits:\n• Patient benefits – Cost savings with fewer copays, convenience of fewer trips to the pharmacy, improved medication adherence, and reduced\nrisk of missing refills.\n• Prescriber benefits – Increased patient adherence equals easier monitoring, reduced administrative burden, increased patient satisfaction, and a more\nstreamlined process for chronic disease management.\n• Pharmacy benefits – Increased patient adherence, improved operational efficiency leading to more time for additional services such as\nimmunizations, medication therapy management (MTM), and enhanced customer satisfaction, resulting in a stronger patient-pharmacy relationship.\nPrescribers should consider writing for a 90-day supply and pharmacies should work with prescribers to switch to a 90-day supply once it is\ndetermined the patient is on a stable dose of a maintenance medication or OTC drug.\nQuestions and Additional Information\nFor questions and additional information regarding this policy, providers should contact NYRx by email at NYRx@health.ny.gov or by telephone at\n(518) 486-3209.\nBack to Top\nNYRx, the Medicaid Pharmacy Program, Clinical Call Center Name Change\nEffective October 1, 2024, Magellan Medicaid Administration, LLC. changed its name to Prime Therapeutics State Government Solutions, LLC.\nThe vendor will continue to operate as the clinical call center for NYRx, the New York State (NYS) Medicaid Pharmacy program.
