While\nindividual practitioners or teams will be credentialed in an EBP, NYS issues EBP authorization to CFTSS\nagencies with OLP and CPST designations. Authorization cannot be granted to private practitioners or group\npractices outside of a CFTSS designated agency. EBP authorization is contingent upon maintenance of OLP\nand CPST designation and ongoing provision of these services when not delivered via the EBP, by the\nagency. Agencies must maintain CFTSS licensing/designation in compliance with related state-issued\nregulations, guidance, or other requirements. Additionally, continued EBP authorization is dependent upon\nadherence to EBP fidelity measures by the program.\nAuthorized EBP agencies can be found on the “EBP Approved Provider” tab of the Designated Children’s\nHCBS and CFTSS Providers list, located on the NYS Department of Health (DOH) “Children and Family\nTreatment and Support Services/Home and Community Based Services” web page, at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/redesign/behavioral_health/children/provider_design.htm,\nas well as on Exhibit 4, which is shared with Mainstream Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) Plans monthly.\nJuly 2025 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 5\n\nTraining\nNYS has partnered with specific proprietary organizations to administer EBP training. Given that training\navailability is limited, EBP authorization is administered in cohorts. Authorized agencies are accepted into a\ntraining cohort, allowing them to initiate training and bill the enhanced NYS Medicaid rates upon completion\nof initial training.\nNYS has partnered with the Center for Workforce Excellence (CWE) at McSilver Institute for Poverty Policy\nand Research at New York University to support the implementation of EBPs in CFTSS. Authorized CFTSS\nEBP providers are required to collaborate with the CWE to facilitate staff trainings, provide requested data,\nand ensure access to supportive technical assistance and associated resources. The CWE serves as the\nconduit between NYS, EBP proprietary organizations and provider agencies. Training for FFT and PCIT\nlaunched in October 2023, with a second cohort of each in January 2025. The first MDFT training cohort is\nanticipated for Summer 2025.\nRates\nThe enhanced rates supplant existing rate codes for CPST or OLP when EBP services are provided, and\nproviders will submit the same type of rate code claim for both individual and family sessions. Further, when\nthe EBP service is delivered off-site, authorized providers will bill the EBP rate code for the corresponding\nservice per the grid below and the off-site rate code. There is no EBP-specific off-site rate code; the standard\noff-site code still applies.

This benefit applies, but\nis not limited to, NYRx-covered OTC medications such as aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen,\nantihistamines, covered vitamins and minerals such as prenatal vitamin, vitamin B, vitamin D,\ncalcium, fluoride and iron preparations. For a complete list of medications covered by NYRx, stakeholders\nshould refer to the eMedNY “Medicaid Pharmacy List of Reimbursable Drugs” web page, located at:\nhttps://www.emedny.org/info/formfile.aspx.\n90-day supplies offer numerous benefits:\n• For patients, cost savings with less copays, convenience of less trips to the pharmacy, improved\nmedication adherence, and reduced risk of missing refills.\n• For prescribers, increased patient adherence equals easier monitoring, reduced administrative\nburden, increased patient satisfaction, and a more streamlined process for chronic disease\nmanagement.\n• For pharmacies, increased patient adherence, improved operational efficiency leading to more time\nfor additional services such as immunizations and medication therapy management (MTM), and\nenhanced customer satisfaction resulting in a stronger patient-pharmacy relationship.\nPrescribers should consider writing for a 90-day supply and pharmacists should work with prescribers to\nswitch to a 90-day supply, once it is determined the patient is on a stable dose of a maintenance\nmedication or OTC drug. Furthermore, pharmacists must submit for package size quantities that\nclosely represent the fiscal order of the prescriber. For instance, if a prescriber writes for a quantity of 90\ntablets and the closest package size is 100 tablets, that can be utilized. Prescribers and pharmacies should\nremind patients to store medications, including over the counter medications, safely and out of the reach of\nchildren.\nQuestions\nQuestions should be directed to NYRx by email at NYRx@health.ny.gov or by telephone at (518) 486-3209.\n"}
