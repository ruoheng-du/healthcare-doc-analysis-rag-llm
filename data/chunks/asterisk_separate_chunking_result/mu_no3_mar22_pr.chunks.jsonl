Enabled by the\nAffordable Care Act, NY State of Health has served as a critical safety net for over 6.5 million New Yorkers\nduring the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency (PHE). COVID-19 PHE-related\nflexibilities and enhanced federal tax credit savings, created under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021\n(ARPA), made coverage even more accessible and affordable.\nAs New York prepares for the eventual transition out of the PHE, and certain Medicaid/Children’s Health\nInsurance Program (CHIP) requirements that were waived resume, the move to conduct eligibility reviews\ncould result in many Medicaid/CHIP beneficiaries becoming disenrolled. The availability of affordable\ncoverage through the Marketplace and the ARPA enhanced tax credits is crucial.\nMarch 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 12\n\nIn March 2022, NY State of Health released data found in the By the Numbers – Health Insurance Coverage\nUpdate document, located at: https://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/sites/default/files/Health%20Insurance%20\nCoverage%20Update%20by%20Congressional%20District%20-%20March%202022.pdf, showing that New\nYorkers who receive enhanced ARPA tax credit savings have greatly benefitted. However, without the\nenhanced tax credit savings and when the PHE ends, individuals who transition from Medicaid and Essential\nPlan – without a monthly premium – to a Qualified Health Plan (QHP) through the Marketplace, may find\ncoverage too expensive, leading to significant increases in uninsured New Yorkers. Under ARPA, New\nYorkers have been receiving enhanced tax credit savings since 2021 that have saved consumers an average\nof $100 per month on QHP premium costs in 2021, making premiums the lowest they have been in years. If\nCongress does not extend these savings beyond 2022, consumers could see their monthly premiums rise by\n58 percent.\nIn the By the Numbers – Health Insurance Coverage Update document, located at: https://info\n.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/sites/default/files/Health%20Insurance%20Coverage%20Update%20by%20Congre\nssional%20District%20-%20March%202022.pdf, NY State of Health reports statistics detailing significant cost\nand coverage implications across New York’s 27 Congressional Districts, specifically relating to the\ncompletion of the PHE. In addition to enrollment data divided by Congressional District, the report also\nprovides statewide information on the negative impact the expiration of ARPA savings would have on New\nYorkers, including:\n• 6.4 million New Yorkers who are enrolled in free or low-cost coverage through NY State of Health,\nwho will need to renew their coverage to remain enrolled when the PHE winddown occurs;\n• 138,008 New Yorkers benefitting from enhanced ARPA tax credits will experience an increase in their\npremiums if these savings are not extended;\n• $1,453 (the annual total among New Yorkers could lose when ARPA subsidies expire at the end of\n2022); and\n• 58 percent (the percent by which premiums will increase for New Yorkers who are eligible for tax\ncredits when they come back to enroll in Fall 2022).\nAmidst the uncertainty of the pandemic, NY State of Health has been an essential source of stability, with\nARPA’s enhanced tax credit savings making coverage more affordable and widely accessible than ever\nbefore.
