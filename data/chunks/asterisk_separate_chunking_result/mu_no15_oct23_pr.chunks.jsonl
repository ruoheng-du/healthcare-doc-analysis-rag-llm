This decision was made due to lower-than-expected participation and lower\nthan projected interventions. Emergency Medical Services remain an area of focus for CMS, and we believe\nthat the lessons learned from the ET3 Model can aid in the development of potential future initiatives. This\ndecision does not affect Model Participants’ participation in the Model through December 31, 2023.” For\nadditional information regarding CMS’ announcement, providers should refer to the CMS “Emergency Triage,\nTreat, and Transport (ET3) Model” web page, located at: https://innovation.cms.gov/innovation-models/et3.\nIn accordance with Title 18 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR) §505.10, located at:\nhttps://regs.health.ny.gov/volume-c-title-18/content/section-50510-transportation-medical-care-and-services,\n“Medicaid payments under the ET3 model will continue only for the duration of the Medicare demonstration\napproved by Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) and will be terminated when either the\ndemonstration period expires or upon termination of Medicare participation by CMMI at any time for any\nreason.” Therefore, the NYS Medicaid ET3 program will end on December 31, 2023.\nThe NYS Department of Health (DOH) Bureau of Emergency Medical Services and Trauma Systems\nStatewide Basic Life Support Adult and Pediatric Treatment Protocols document, located at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/professionals/ems/pdf/statewide_bls_v23.1.pdf, instructs EMS providers to,\n“transport (patients) to the closest appropriate receiving facility in accordance with regional facility destination\npolicies for travel time, facility capabilities, and NY State designation.” Therefore, when practicing in\ncompliance with these protocols, NYS Medicaid will continue to pay for emergency ambulance transportation\nto urgent care centers, federally qualified healthcare centers (FQHCs), mental health or substance use\ndisorder treatment centers, and physician offices. This policy applies to all enrolled ambulance providers and\nis not limited only to those that had previously obtained CMS ET3 approval. For dates of service after\nDecember 31, 2023, NYS Medicaid payments can no longer be made to any ambulance provider for\ntreatment in place.\nQuestions\nQuestions regarding this matter should be directed to the NYS DOH Medical Transportation Unit by telephone\nat (518) 473-2160 or by email at MedTrans@health.ny.gov.\n"}

CMS, along with their contractor and NYS Office\nof the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG), have the authority to collect information under sections\n1902(a)(27) and 2107(b)(1) of the Social Security Act. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability\nAct of 1996 (HIPAA) statutes and regulations require the provision of such information upon request, and the\ninformation can be provided without patient consent.\nEmpower Al (formerly NCI Inc.) is returning as the CMS review contractor, and in partnership with NYS OMIG,\nwill be requesting documentation from providers for randomly selected claims to perform a medical review.\nResults of the last cycle showed the state error rate for medical reviews was 1.63 percent, compared to a\nnational average of 13.9 percent*. NYS OMIG was also able to successfully overturn over three quarters of\nclaims originally determined to be in error utilizing records submitted by providers in response to\ndocumentation requests. Therefore, as with prior PERM reviews, although NYS OMIG will pursue appropriate\naction for payments determined to be in error, providers generally benefit from cooperating with requests for\ndocumentation.\n*For additional information regarding the national average error rate for medical reviews, providers can refer to the Department of\nHealth and Human Services – Agency Financial Report – Fiscal Year 2021, located at: https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2021-\nhhs-agency-financial-report.pdf.\nIf the submitted claim of a provider is selected for review, the CMS contractor and NYS OMIG will request\nwritten documentation to substantiate claims paid. Providers are asked to submit copies of the specific\nmedical documents for the patient. This will be requested in the letter received from the CMS contractor, with\ninstructions to submit the records directly to the CMS contractor with a second copy to NYS OMIG. For\nproviders who submit records, please ensure that the records are sent in a secure manner. Email and faxes\nare preferred, as they aid in efficiency. Records may also be mailed to the following address:\nAttention: PERM\nOffice of the Medicaid Inspector General\n800 North Pearl Street First Floor\nAlbany, NY 12204\nRequests for documentation are anticipated to begin in late Fall 2023. The audit period of sampled claims\nare those paid between July 1, 2022, and June 30, 2023. Requests and subsequent receipt or non-receipt of\ndocumentation will be tracked. Compliance with medical record requests and providing full medical records\nfor the randomly selected claims is required. Failure to provide requested records will result in a determination\nby CMS of erroneous payment and NYS OMIG will pursue recovery.\nQuestions\nQuestions should be directed to the PERM Project Staff by telephone at (518) 408-0844 or by email at\nPERMNY@omig.ny.gov.\n"}
