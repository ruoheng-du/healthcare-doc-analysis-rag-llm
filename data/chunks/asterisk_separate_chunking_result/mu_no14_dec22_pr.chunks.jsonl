OMIG has the responsibility under SOS §363-d and Subpart 521-\n1 to determine if compliance programs meet the requirements of the law and regulation.

The OMIG Bureau of Compliance regularly conducts reviews of providers to ensure they have\na compliance program, if required, and that the compliance program is effective.\nRequired providers who fall under the requirements of the regulation are required to certify upon enrollment\nand annually using the eMedNY/Medicaid Management Information System – Certification Statement for\nProvider Billing Medicaid form (EMEDNY 490601), located at: https://www. emedny.org/info/\nProviderEnrollment/ProviderMaintForms/490501_ETIN_CERT_Certification_Statement_Cert_Instructions_f\nor_Existing_ETINs.pdf.

This form must be completed and returned by the enrollment\nanniversary date. Failure to adopt, implement, and maintain an effective compliance program may result in\nsanctions or penalties, including, but not limited to, the revocation of the provider's agreement to participate\nin the NYS Medicaid program.\nAdditional guidance and information on compliance requirements can be found on the OMIG website, located\nat: https://omig.ny.gov.

The policy regarding\npharmacy billing of drugs that require practitioner-administration can be found in the New York State Medicaid\nFee-for-Service Program Pharmacy Manual Policy Guidelines, located at: https://www.emedny\n.org/ProviderManuals/Pharmacy/PDFS/Pharmacy_Policy_Guidelines.pdf, under the “Delivery” section. The\npolicy regarding PAD billing can be found in the New York State Medicaid Program Physician Policy\nGuidelines manual, located on the eMedNY “Physician Manual” web page at:\nhttps://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/Physician/index.aspx.\nPADs dispensed as a Pharmacy Benefit must be delivered by the pharmacy directly to the site of\nadministration. This is considered “white bagging” and is acceptable under the following guidelines:\n• Prior to the delivery of a PAD, the dispensing pharmacy must confirm the delivery address, if the NYS\nMedicaid member still requires the drug, and that an appointment has been scheduled and confirmed\nfor its administration. Automatic refills are not permitted. The policy regarding refills can be found in\nthe New York State Medicaid Fee-for-Service Program Pharmacy Manual Policy Guidelines, located\nat: https://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/Pharmacy/PDFS/Pharmacy_Policy_Guidelines.pdf,\nunder the “Refills” section.\n• Delivery charges may not be billed to the NYS Medicaid program or the NYS Medicaid member.\n• The pharmacy is responsible for preparing and delivering the drug, in accordance with administration\nguidelines in the package insert, as well as the replacement of improperly stored, lost, or stolen drugs\nuntil there is a confirmed receipt by the authorized agent.\n• The pharmacy is required to obtain documentation of delivery by the receipt of an authorized agent’s\nsignature at the site of administration.\n• All NYS Medicaid program claims for drugs that were not deliverable must be reversed within 14 days.\n• Once delivered and signed for, the site of administration is responsible for the replacement of\nimproperly stored, handled, lost, or stolen PADs.\nPlease note: Drugs should only be dispensed by the pharmacy directly to the patient when they are to be\nself-administered. The policy surrounding self-administered drug delivery can be found in the New York State\nMedicaid Fee-for-Service Program Pharmacy Manual Policy Guidelines, located at: https://www\n.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/Pharmacy/PDFS/Pharmacy_Policy_Guidelines.pdf, under the “Delivery”\nsection.\nPADs dispensed directly to a patient by the pharmacy to bring to their practitioner’s office for administration\nis considered “brown bagging”.
