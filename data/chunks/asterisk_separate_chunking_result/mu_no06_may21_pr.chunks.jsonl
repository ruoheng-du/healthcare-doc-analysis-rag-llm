This provision applies\nonly to outpatient diagnostic and non-diagnostic services furnished within one day prior to and including the\ndate of the member’s admission to:\n• psychiatric hospital/unit,\n• inpatient rehabilitation facility/unit,\n• long-term acute care hospital,\n• children’s hospital, or\n• cancer hospital.\nThe three-day (or one-day) payment window policy does not apply to outpatient diagnostic or non-diagnostic\nservices included in the Rural Health Clinic (RHC) or Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) All-Inclusive\nRate (AIR). The technical portion of any outpatient diagnostic or non-diagnostic service rendered to a member\nat a hospital-owned or hospital-operated physician clinic or practice during the payment window is subject to\nthe three-day (or one-day) payment window policy. The three-day (or one-day) payment window policy does\nnot apply when the admitting hospital is a Critical Access Hospital (CAH). Outpatient diagnostic and non-\ndiagnostic services rendered to a member by a CAH, or by an entity that is wholly owned or operated by a\nCAH during the payment window, must not be bundled on the claim for the member’s inpatient admission to\na CAH. However, outpatient diagnostic and non-diagnostic services rendered to a member at a CAH that is\nwholly owned or operated by a non-CAH hospital, during the payment window, are subject to the three-day\n(or one-day) payment window policy. Please note: Admissions to skilled nursing facilities, home health\nagencies, and hospices are excluded from these payment window provisions.\nMay 2021 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 10\n\nNon-Diagnostic Services Unrelated to Admission\nNon-diagnostic preadmission services are considered related to the admission when there is an exact match\nbetween the principal diagnosis code assigned for both the preadmission services and the inpatient stay.\nOutpatient non-diagnostic services provided during the payment window that are unrelated to the admission\nmay be billed separately. Hospitals must maintain documentation in the member’s medical record to support\ntheir claim that the preadmission outpatient non-diagnostic services are unrelated to the inpatient admission.\nIf there are both diagnostic and non-diagnostic preadmission services and the non-diagnostic services are\nunrelated to the admission, the hospital may separately bill the non-diagnostic preadmission services on an\noutpatient claim. Outpatient claims for nondiagnostic services unrelated to the admission can be billed\nseparately and must use Condition Code 51 (definition “51 - Attestation of Unrelated Outpatient Non-\ndiagnostic Services”).\nQuestions:\n• Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) coverage and policy questions should be directed to the Office of\nHealth Insurance Programs (OHIP), Division of Program Development and Management (DPDM), by\nphone at (518) 473-2160 or by email at FFSMedicaidPolicy@health.ny.gov.\n• Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) reimbursement, billing, and/or documentation requirement questions\nshould be directed to the enrollee's MMC Plan.\n• FFS claim questions should be directed to the eMedNY Call Center at (800) 343-9000.\n"}
