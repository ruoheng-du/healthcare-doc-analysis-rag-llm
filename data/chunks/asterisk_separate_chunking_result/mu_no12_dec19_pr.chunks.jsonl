Once a\nPending, Preliminary, or Full CDC recognition is obtained, providers can apply to become a Medicaid\nNDPP service provider. Additional information about participating in the NYS Medicaid program as an\nNDPP service provider, including the required NDPP provider enrollment forms, can be found at:\nhttps://www.emedny.org/info/providerenrollment/ndpp/index.aspx.\n3.

This policy applies to mainstream MMC plans, HIV Special\nNeeds Plans (HIV SNPs), and Health and Recovery Plans (HARPs).\nPrevious Medicaid Update articles regarding gender dysphoria can be found in the following issues:\n• June 2015 Medicaid Update, “New York State Medicaid Updates Regulations”\n• May 2016 Medicaid Update, “Transgender Related Care and Services Update”\n• January 2017 Medicaid Update, “Transgender Related Care and Services Update”\nVerification of Patient Safety to Undergo Surgery\nMMC plans are permitted to implement processes to verify and ensure a member’s safety to undergo\nsurgery for the treatment of gender dysphoria. Such processes may not include medical necessity reviews\nfor procedures listed under paragraph (4) of 18 New York Code, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR) §505.2(l) but\ncan include medical necessity reviews for other procedures not listed under paragraph (4) of 18 NYCRR\n§505.2(l). Patient safety verification processes can include verifying that a member is medically cleared/medically\nappropriate to undergo surgery from a general health status aspect, and that all of the member’s care providers\n(i.e., primary care providers, behavioral health providers, and surgeons) are working as a team and agree on the\nmember’s care plan for surgery. It is important to note that such patient safety verification processes can only\nbe implemented by an MMC plan if verifying member safety to undergo surgery is routinely done by the MMC\nplan as a standard of practice for all surgeries. An MMC plan cannot restrict or limit verification of a member’s\nsafety to undergo surgery to surgeries performed for the treatment of gender dysphoria.\nDecember 2019 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 3\n\n[OCR Supplement]\nPolicy and Billing\nPolicy and Billing |\nPolicy and Billing\n\nRequests for Surgical Revisions for the Treatment of Gender Dysphoria\nThe NYS Medicaid program, both FFS and MMC, covers surgical revisions (modifications and/or\ncorrections to a prior surgery) for the treatment of gender dysphoria. MMC plans are required to handle\nrequests for surgical revisions for the treatment of gender dysphoria in the same manner as initial surgical\nrequests for the treatment of gender dysphoria. Surgical revision requests for procedures listed under paragraph\n(4) of 18 NYCRR §505.2(l) cannot be subjected to medical necessity reviews, but medical necessity reviews can\nbe applied to other procedures not listed under paragraph (4) of 18 NYCRR §505.2(l). MMC plans may also\nimplement processes to verify and ensure a member’s safety to undergo surgery, including surgical revisions,\nfor the treatment of gender dysphoria, as described above.\nMental Health Counseling Requirements for the Surgical Treatment of Gender Dysphoria\nPrior to surgery for the treatment of gender dysphoria, 18 NYCRR §505.2(l)(3)(i)(c) requires documentation that\nthe member has lived in a gender role congruent with the member’s gender identity for 12 months. The regulation\nalso requires documentation of mental health counseling, as deemed medically necessary by the qualified health\nprofessional treating the member, during that time. For additional information related to the mental health\ncounseling referral letter requirements, please refer to the above referenced Medicaid Update article titled, ”New\nYork State Medicaid Updates Regulations.” The duration and frequency of mental health counseling related to\nthe surgical treatment of gender dysphoria is dependent on the member’s unique clinical profile and\nbiopsychosocial circumstances. There is no requirement that mental health counseling be provided continuously\nfor 12 months prior to surgery for the treatment of gender dysphoria.\nQuestions:\n• Medicaid FFS prior approval, prior authorization and/or medical necessity requirement questions should\nbe directed to Office of Health Insurance Programs (OHIP) Division of Operations and Systems at\n(800) 342-3005 or via email at OHIPMedPA@health.ny.gov.\n• Medicaid FFS coverage and policy questions should be directed to OHIP, Division of Program\nDevelopment and Management at (518) 473-2160.\n• MMC general coverage questions should be directed to OHIP, Division of Health Plan Contracting and\nOversight at (518) 473-1134 or via email at covques@health.ny.gov.\n• MMC reimbursement, billing, and/or documentation requirement questions should be directed to the\nenrollee's MMC plan.\n• FFS claim qu"}
