The enhanced fee will be implemented over a period of three years. These changes were\nauthorized in the Fiscal Year 2021 enacted budget.\nThe enhancements include, but are not limited to:\n• increasing Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) rates of payment over three years for providers who\nparticipate in the PDN Directory;\n• increasing the maximum age of coverage under the PDN program for MFC from 21 years to 23 years;\n• moving from county-based fees to State level-based fees;\n• establishing upstate and downstate regional fees; and\n• creating a new PDN Directory on the New York State Department of Health (DOH) web site. The\npurpose of the Directory is to ensure adequate access to PDN services by promoting the\navailability and ensuring delivery of PDN services for MFC up to the age of 23.\nIn order to assist providers and interested parties in staying up-to-date on process changes related to the\nPDN program, all are encouraged to sign up for the LISTSERV which can be found on the eMedNY website\nat: https://www.emedny.org/Listserv/eMedNY_Email_Alert_System.aspx.

Since\nMedicaid is the payer of last resort, the provider must bill the member’s third-party payers prior to requesting\npayment from Medicaid. If the third party is a commercial plan, Medicaid will reimburse the difference only if\nthe total third-party payment(s) is (are) less than the lesser of the provider’s fee charged to the general public\nor the fee developed by New York State Department of Health (DOH) for the specific procedure code. If the\nthird party is a Medicare Advantage plan, Medicaid will reimburse eighty-five percent (85%) of the patient\nresponsibility. Prior to initiating treatment which has been approved by a third-party insurance plan, the\nprovider should obtain a prior approval from Medicaid to ensure that the treatment plan falls within the current\nguidelines of the Medicaid Program. Failure to do so may result in the denial of Medicaid benefits for these\nservices.\nWhen to Submit a Prior Approval Change of Request Form\nIf a change is needed or there exists a disagreement with a prior approval review and there is need to\nchallenge a determination rendered by DOH on an existing finalized prior approval, a request may be\nsubmitted with supporting documentation and a detailed report using a “Prior Approval Change Request\nForm”. This form may be submitted pre-operatively or post-operatively, if the requested change is submitted\npost-operatively, a copy of the treatment notes should be included with the request. The Prior Approval\nChange Request Form can be obtained at: https://www.emedny.org/info/phase2/paper.aspx or by calling\neMedNY at (800) 343-9000.\nWhen to Submit a Claim for Payment for Fixed and Removable Prosthetics\nClaims for fixed and removable prosthetics (including implant related prosthetics) are not to be submitted\nuntil the procedure has been completed and inserted in the patient’s mouth. The final insertion date is the\ndate of service.\nQuestions regarding this article should be directed to dental@health.ny.gov.\n"}

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is dedicated to improving interoperability\nand patient access to health information. The NY Medicaid EHR Incentive Program is a part of the CMS\nPromoting Interoperability Program but will continue to operate under the current name of NY Medicaid EHR\nIncentive Program.\nPayment Year (PY) 2020 Soft Opening Period\nAs the timeframes between PYs become shorter, providers who are ready to attest will be given the\nopportunity to do so before the official PY opening, by means of a process called a soft opening. The soft\nopening will function in the same way an official opening does, with remediation and review processes that\nmirror what providers are used to. The main differences are that soft openings occur earlier in the year, and\nbecause of this the Meaningful Use (MU) criteria must be met sooner than normal if a provider wishes to\nattest during this period.\nThe PY 2020 Soft Opening period is happening now. Providers who have met the attestation criteria will\nbe able to complete their attestations in the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program Administrative Support Service\n(MEIPASS). Providers may login to the MEIPASS system at: https://meipass.emedny.org/ehr/login.xhtml.\nProviders are encouraged to gather and submit their attestation data during this time. The Soft Opening Period\nwill continue until the Official Opening on January 1, 2021.\nPY 2020 Pre-validation Period\nIf EPs or a group of EPs have already selected their reporting period and calculated their patient volume prior\nto the MEIPASS attestation system being opened for the PY, the EPs are able to complete a Pre-validation.\nA Pre-validation allows providers to submit their patient volume data for review and approval ahead of\nattestation and can allow the EPs to advance through the review process more quickly once MEIPASS begins\naccepting attestations.\nPre-validations for PY 2020 will be accepted from September 14, 2020 through December 14, 2020. If\nproviders would like to take advantage of this service and avoid patient volume remediation during the official\nor soft opening attestation periods, they must begin the process of finding a suitable Medicaid patient volume\nreporting period. To submit a Pre-validation, simply select your Patient Volume Reporting period and fill out\nthe appropriate Pre-validation form with the data for that period. Forms can be found on the Document\nRepository page of the EHR web site at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/redesign/ehr/\nrepository/index.htm.\nCheck Provider Participation\nAt minimum*, a provider must have completed and received an incentive payment for one PY in 2016 or\nearlier to participate for future years. Providers uncertain about their participation status are encouraged to\nreach out to the NY Medicaid EHR Incentive Program support team for assistance. Program participation\nstatus can be verified and reviewed using the provider’s National Provider Identifier (NPI) and may assist in\ndetermining a provider’s ability to attest in PY 2019-2021. Providers who wish to check their participation\nstatus should contact the support team at (877) 646-5410 (Option 2) or via email at hit@health.ny.gov.\nSeptember 2020 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 5\n\n[OCR Supplement]\nAll Providers\n| All Providers |\nAll Providers\nAll Providers\n| All Providers |\nAll Providers\n\n*Providers must also meet all other relevant program requirements and metrics to be eligible to participate in the NY Medicaid EHR\nIncentive Program.\nLISTSERV Communications\nAdditional information and program changes are announced periodically, especially as the program begins\nits final years.
