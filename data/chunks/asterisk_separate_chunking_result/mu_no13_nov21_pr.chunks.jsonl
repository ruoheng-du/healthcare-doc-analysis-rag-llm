If a Medicaid member has third-party insurance coverage, the benefits\nof that coverage must be fully used before billing the NYS Medicaid program. Providers should always ask a\nMedicaid member if they have other third-party coverage to ensure the proper coordination of benefits.\nAll claims submitted for members with Medicare and/or other third-party insurance must accurately reflect\npayments and denials received from other insurers to allow correct calculation of Medicaid reimbursement\namounts. The Explanation of Benefits (EOB) and other documentation supporting Medicare with third-party\nreimbursement amounts must be kept then made available upon request for audit or inspection by the NYS\nDepartment of Health (DOH), the Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG), the Office of the State\nComptroller (OSC), or other state or federal agencies responsible for audit functions.\nAdditionally, for any claims submitted to Medicaid with zero-fill reimbursement from Medicare or third-party\ninsurer, providers must retain evidence that the claims were initially billed to Medicare and/or third-party\ninsurers then were denied before seeking reimbursement from Medicaid. The exception to this policy, in\nwhich providers may bill Medicaid directly without first receiving denials, is for items that are statutorily not\ncovered by the Medicare program. Providers are responsible for retaining the statutory exemptions from\nMedicare for audit or inspection.\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• Fee-for-service (FFS) claim questions should be directed to the eMedNY Call Center at (800) 343-\n9000.\n• FFS coverage and policy questions should be directed to the Office of Health Insurance Programs\n(OHIP) Division of Program Development and Management (DPDM) by telephone at (518) 473-2160\nor by email at FFSMedicaidPolicy@health.ny.gov.\n• Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) reimbursement, billing, and/or documentation requirement questions\nshould be directed to enrollee MMC Plans.\n• MMC Plan contact information can be found in the eMedNY New York State Medicaid Program\nInformation for All Providers Managed Care Information document, located at:\nhttps://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/AllProviders/PDFS/Information_for_All_Providers_Manag\ned_Care_Information.pdf.\n"}

Food insecurity is associated with poor health and\nincreased use of high-cost health services such as Emergency Department (ED) visits as well as inpatient\nadmissions. Food insecurity and its associated risks are especially applicable for individuals with severe\nchronic illness. Providing MTM to medically complex individuals is one of the strategies being implemented\nby Medicaid to address food insecurity and malnutrition.\nDefinitions:\n• “ILS” is used to define an alternative physical and behavioral health service or setting, not included\nin the State Plan, that is a “medically appropriate and cost-effective” substitute for a covered service\nor setting.\n• “State approved ILS” signifies an ILS proposed by an MMCO that has been approved by the State.\n• \"State Identified ILS” signifies an ILS that is traditionally not covered under the Medicaid State Plan\nbut identified by the State as a “medically appropriate and cost-effective substitute”, under 2016\nFederal Rule 42 CFR §438.6(e), for the Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) program.\nThe use of the ILS is voluntary for MMCOs and MMC enrollees.\nState Identified ILS for MTM\nThe State Identified ILS for MTM is targeted to MMC enrollees with at least one of the following diagnoses:\ncancer, diabetes, heart failure, and/or HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)/AIDS (Acquired\nImmunodeficiency Syndrome). It will allow home delivered MTM to be available to individuals 18 years of age\nor older, living with severe illness, through a referral from a medical professional or healthcare plan. Meal\nplans will be tailored to the medical needs of the recipient by a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) and\ndesigned to improve health outcomes, lower cost of care, as well as increase patient satisfaction. MTM\nservices include an initial intake with a RDN, and nutritional therapy, to discuss meal composition. MTM may\nbe provided in lieu of Personal Care Aide (PCA) services hours allotted for meal preparation and food\nshopping; therefore, authorized PCA hours will be reduced for members receiving MTM services.\nNovember 2021 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 10\n\nMTM services can also be provided to enrollees as preventative intervention to reduce the risk and incidence\nof high-volume hospital inpatient stays and/or ED visits related to cancer, diabetes, heart failure, and/or\nHIV/AIDS, without reductions to PCA hours. High-volume service utilization is defined as:\n• Two or more hospital inpatient stays related to cancer, diabetes, heart failure, and/or HIV/AIDS within\nthe last 12 months; or\n• Five or more ED visits related to cancer, diabetes, heart failure, and/or HIV/AIDS within the last 12\nmonths; or\n• One hospital inpatient stay with four ED visits related to cancer, diabetes, heart failure, and/or\nHIV/AIDS within the last 12 months.\nProviders and MMCOs that are interested in making this benefit available to members can refer to additional\ninformation on the State Identified ILS for MTM, including the State Identified Request Form for In Lieu of\nServices for Medically Tailored Meals, which can be found on the NYS DOH “Information for Health Plans”\nweb page at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/managed_care/plans/.\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• Fee-for-Service (FFS) coverage and policy questions should be directed to the Office of Health\nInsurance Programs (OHIP) Division of Program Development and Management (DPDM) by\ntelephone at (518) 473-2160 or by email at FFSMedicaidPolicy@health.ny.gov.\n• FFS claim questions should be directed to the eMedNY Call Center at (800) 343-9000.\n• MMC reimbursement, billing, and/or documentation requirement questions should be directed to the\nenrollee MMC Plans.\n• MMC Plan contact information can be found in the eMedNY New York State Medicaid Program\nInformation for All Providers Managed Care Information document at:\nhttps://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/AllProviders/PDFS/Information_for_All_Providers_Manag\ned_Care_Information.pdf.\n"}

To prevent\nduplicate discounts from taking place, NYS Medicaid exclusively uses claim level identifiers on either National\nCouncil for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) or Institutional claim types (837P/837I). Additional\ninformation on the use of claim level identifiers, previously stated in the December 2016 issue of the Medicaid\nUpdate, in the article titled NYS Medicaid Change in 340B Claim Identification Effective 04/01/2017, can be\nfound at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2016/dec16_mu.pdf.\nClaim level identifiers are required for any 340B purchased drug billed to Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS),\nMedicaid Managed Care (MMC) Plan or as a secondary claim. It is the responsibility of the covered entity\n(CE) and their contracted pharmacies, if applicable, to correctly identify claims dispensed with the 340B stock\nof the CE for 340B-eligible Medicaid patients to ensure rebates are not collected for these drugs. If rebates\nare received by the NYS Department of Health (DOH) for drugs obtained via the 340B program due to\nincorrect or missing claim level identifiers, the CE is responsible for reimbursing manufacturers the\n340B discounts.\nThe following table outlines the necessary fields and their values for various claim types to identify 340B-\npurchased drug claims.

The 340B ceiling price refers to the maximum amount\nthat a manufacturer can charge the CE for the purchase of a 340B covered outpatient drug. A claim submitted\nto Medicaid should never be higher than the 340B ceiling price. Any pharmacy that submits a 340B drug\nclaim, whenever the ingredient cost submitted is higher than the ceiling price, will be returned the Medicaid\nEligibility Verification System (MEVS) Rx Denial code “708: Exceeds NY Allowed Maximum” and the\nNCPDP Reject code \"23: M/I Ingredient Cost”.

A\nphysician-administered drug will not be paid under Ambulatory Patient Groups (APGs) if the claim does not\ninclude an accurate NDC.

Medicaid\nregulations at 18NYCRR §540.6(e) require a provider to pursue any available other coverage prior to\nsubmitting a claim to Medicaid. If there is a responsible third party who should be paying for the Medicaid\nmember’s health benefits as primary payor, that responsible third party must pay first. As previously\ncommunicated in the October 2020 issue of the Medicaid Update, in the article titled Notification to Providers\nof Requirement to Attach Explanation of Benefits from Third-Party Payors to Medicaid Claims, available at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2020/docs/mu_no15_oct20.pdf, failure to\nobtain prior authorization does not overcome the responsibility of the primary payor.\nClaims for members with other coverage will deny at point of service with National Council for Prescription\nDrug Programs (NCPDP) response code/message “717- Client Has Other Insurance”. Through\ncoordination of benefits, Medicaid will pay the patient responsibility for correctly submitted Medicaid coverable\nclaims or will pay up to the Medicaid allowed amounts for drugs in classes specifically excluded from being\ncovered under the third-party liability (TPL) Plan, including Medicare.\nAs previously communicated in the December 2020 issue of the Medicaid Update, in the article titled\nSubmission Guidance for Fee-for-Service Claims with Third Party Liability (Medicare or Other Insurance),\navailable at https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2020/docs/mu_no18_dec20\n_pr.pdf, a claim submitted to NYS Medicaid with a zero-fill reimbursement from any TPL Plan must be\nsubmitted. A pharmacy provider who receives a zero-fill response must ensure that the claim was adjudicated\nwithin each TPL Plan claim process requirement. This includes submitting a claim under the appropriate\ncoverage benefit, medical or pharmacy, such as with the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System\n(HCPCS) or by National Drug Code (NDC). Additionally, a pharmacy not contracted with member TPL Plans\nmay need to attempt overrides with plans, or enroll with the plans, or advise members and prescribers of the\nneed to change dispensing to network pharmacies.\nPrescribers are responsible for prescribing per plan formulary and pursuing any claim issues such as, but not\nlimited to, the following:\n• necessary prior authorizations or appeals;\n• prescription alternatives (for a non-formulary or non-preferred drug);\n• necessary changes (quantity or day supply, etc.);\n• selection of an in-network pharmacy that is agreeable to the member; or\n• the billing of the appropriate benefit (medical versus pharmacy or HCPCS versus NDC).\nPharmacies are responsible for submitting claims to other coverage before submitting claims to Medicaid.\nPharmacies that have difficulty billing primary coverage should advise prescribers and members of potential\ndelays as well as options for resolution. If claim issues are resolved, the pharmacies may then resubmit the\nclaims to Medicaid after the claims are properly adjudicated with the TPL Plans.\nSubmitting TPL-covered claims that incorrectly bypass the TPL Plan responsibility of payment is considered\ninaccurate billing and may be subject to audit recoveries. Reminder: Providers must maintain evidence\nand documentation, which are subject to audit, for a minimum of six years following the date of\nMedicaid payment.
