Each year, thousands of children and adults become seriously ill and are hospitalized\nbecause of diseases that vaccines can help prevent. Providers have the power to ensure their patients are\nprotected from serious diseases like measles, cancers caused by HPV, and seasonal flu! By ensuring patients\nget recommended vaccines, providers can help protect them from much of this unnecessary suffering. The\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the New York State Department of Health (NYS DOH)\nhave resources available for providers and their patients about vaccines. Information for children, adolescents\nand adults can be found at: https://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/immunization/.\nMany children need to receive vaccines during the summer to stay up-to-date and comply with school\nvaccination requirements. The 2020-21 School Year New York State Immunization Requirements for School\nEntrance/Attendance can be found at: https://www.health.ny.gov/publications/2370.pdf.\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic has brought unique challenges to the healthcare system. SARS-CoV-2 is\nexpected to continue to circulate in the fall. Increasing influenza coverage this season will decrease stress on\nthe healthcare system by decreasing doctor visits and hospitalizations. Healthcare providers are encouraged\nto focus on reaching adults at higher risk of complications from COVID-19, such as those with underlying\nillnesses and African Americans.\nThe NYS Vaccine Program participates in federally funded programs that supply vaccines to providers who\ntreat underinsured or uninsured patients. Additional information on how to enroll in the Vaccines for Children\n(VFC) Program, can be found at: https://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/immunization/vaccines_for_children/.\nAdditional information on enrollment in the Vaccines for Adults (VFA) Program can be found at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/immunization/providers/state_vaccines_for_adults_program.htm.\nQuestions should be directed to the NYS Vaccine Pr"}

This allows practices to submit\ntheir patient volume data for review and approval ahead of attestation and can help the EP advance through\nthe review process more quickly once MEIPASS begins accepting attestations.\nPre-Validations for PY 2020 will be accepted from September 14, 2020 to December 14, 2020. If providers\nwould like to take advantage of this service to avoid patient volume remediation during the official or soft\nopening attestation periods, they need to begin the process of finding a suitable Medicaid patient volume\nreporting period. More information on how to submit a Pre-Validation will be made available as the acceptance\nperiod draws closer.\nCheck Participation Status\nAt minimum*, a provider must have completed and received an incentive payment for one payment year in\nPY 2016 or earlier to participate for future years.

All\npharmacy claims included in the rate must be billed to the facility. Practitioner administered drugs (also\nknown as physician administered drugs) are not a covered benefit for LTC and FC residing members, these\ndrugs should be billed to the facility. Information on LTC pharmacy claims can be found in the June 2011\nSpecial Edition Medicaid Update; information regarding Foster Care claims can be found at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/carveout.htm.\nThe following process is necessary to successfully bill pharmacy claims that are not covered in the rate by\nidentifying and billing the appropriate coverage. Additionally, this guidance must be followed prior to sending\nNew York State (NYS) Medicaid requests for retroactive claim overrides.\nDetermine Third-Party Liability (TPL) and Medicaid Eligibility Coverage\nProviders must use any and all resources available to determine eligibility coverage including:\n• the facility billing office,\n• Medicaid Eligibility Verifying Eligibility & Third-Party Liability System (MEVS) (https://www.emedny\n.org/ProviderManuals/AllProviders/supplemental.aspx),\n• Electronic Provider Assisted Claim Entry System (ePACES) (https://www.emedny.org/epaces/),\n• the local district office.\nProviders should check for TPL and eligibility coverage updates at least twice monthly following the first\nDate of Service (DOS). NY State Medicaid is always the payor of last resort, every effort must be taken\nto obtain correct billing information. Inaccurate billing that causes an overpayment is recoverable by audit\nand puts the pharmacy at risk to the loss of their enrollment, [18 New York Consolidated Rules and\nRegulations (NYCRR) 348.1, 360-7.7, 504.3].\nWhen TPL is applicable, providers must bill TPL first, including commercial plans or Medicare, billing\nMedicaid if appropriate as secondary. Any claim issues must be resolved with the third party, including prior\nauthorization (PA) requirements, prior to submitting the claim to Medicaid. Note: If the primary insurer does\nnot cover a medication, Medicaid will not cover the claim. Failure to submit the claim to the third party will\nresult in denial of the claim by Medicaid.\nWhen a member has Medicare, providers will bill:\n• Medicare Part B for Part B covered drugs (Part B coverage information can be found at:\nhttps://www.medicare.gov/what-medicare-covers/what-part-b-covers), or\n• Medicare Part D or a Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MAPD) contracting plan (Part C)\nfor other prescription drugs (Part D coverage information can be found at: https://www.medicare\ngov/drug-coverage-part-d.\nWhen a member has Medicare Parts A or B or both and is not enrolled in Medicare Part D, providers will bill\nPart D covered claims to the Limited Income Newly Eligible Transition (LINET) program per: https://www.\ncms.gov/Medicare/Eligibility-and-Enrollment/LowIncSubMedicarePresCov/MedicareLimitedIncomeNET.html\nto initiate Medicare Part D enrollment and also facilitate payment of claim.\nWhen a member has Medicare Part C, it is imperative the pharmacy bill correctly: bill Part B covered drugs\nto the Part B portion of their coverage and, likewise, bill Part D covered drugs to the Part D portion of their\ncoverage.\nJuly 2020 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 7\n\nBilling Claims That Require Medicaid PA\nFor members whose active eligibility status began after the date the pharmacy service was provided\n(retroactive billing):\n• If date of notification of eligibility is within 90 days of DOS, call Magellan for PA at (877) 309-9493.\n• If date of notification of eligibility is after 90 days of DOS, and the bypass explained in this Medicaid\nUpdate article titled Updated Pharmacy Guidance for Long term (LTC) Providers and Prior\nAuthorization Requirements is inappropriate to the claim, LTC/FC Facility servicing pharmacies may\nsend the claim information for retro-PA consideration to the Medicaid Pharmacy unit at\nPPNO@health.ny.gov.

Information regarding timely billing can be found at: https://www.emedny\n.org/ProviderManuals/AllProviders/Guide_to_Timely_Billing.pdf.\n• All pharmacies that are not required to bill the facility (pharmacy benefit not included in the rate) must\nsubmit their transactions through the online Prospective Drug Utilization Review (Pro-DUR) program\n(https://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/Pharmacy/ProDUR-ECCA_Provider_Manual/index.aspx)\nusing the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) transaction format.

This is the opportune time to\nexplore non-PA alternatives and facilitate payment. A PA will not be issued by the clinical call center\nfor a member who is ineligible.\n• Original prescriptions must be filled within 60 days (30 days for controlled substances) of prescriber\nwritten/order date; a system edit will deny claims beyond this limitation.

Medicaid requires providers to exhaust all\nexisting benefits prior to billing the Medicaid program. If a Medicaid member has third-party insurance\ncoverage, the benefits of that coverage must fully be utilized before billing the NYS Medicaid program.\nProviders should always ask Medicaid members if they have other third-party coverage to ensure the proper\ncoordination of benefits. Medicaid is always the payor of last resort; federal regulations require that all\nother available resources be used before Medicaid considers payment. If there is a responsible third-\nparty that should be paying for the members' health benefits, such as a health insurance provider, the\nresponsible third-party should pay first.\nAll claims submitted for members with Medicare and/or other third-party insurance must accurately reflect\npayments and denials received from other insurers to allow correct calculation of Medicaid reimbursement\namounts.

Serial\nnumbers are a unique alphanumeric number on the bottom right of an Official New York Prescription Form\n(ONYSRx). The table below describes all the different circumstances a prescription may be obtained at\nvarious pharmacy types; and will assist in choosing the correct match. Note: Prescriptions received from a\n‘care coordinator’ or other party other than the prescribing practitioner are not valid.\nIt has been noticed that many pharmacies are billing with incorrect information; there have been and will\ncontinue to be audits on these fields submitted by pharmacies.
