Federal law 42 United States Code (USC) 256b(a)(5)(A)(i), located at: https://www\n.hrsa.gov/opa/program-requirements/medicaid-exclusion#:~:text=42%20USC%20256b(a)(,place%20to%20\nprevent%20duplicate%20discounts, prohibits duplicate discounts, such that drug manufacturers are not\nrequired to provide a discounted 340B price and a NYS Medicaid drug rebate for the same drug. To prevent\nduplicate discounts, NYS Medicaid exclusively uses claim level identifiers on either National Council for\nPrescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) or Professional/Institutional claim types (837P/837I) on eligible 340B\npurchased claims. Information on how outpatient clinics bill for 340B drugs can be found in the Clarification\nof Previous Guidance: New York State Medicaid Fee-for-Service Coverage of Practitioner Administered\nDrugs article published in the July 2022 issue of the Medicaid Update, located at: https://\nwww.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2022/docs/mu_no8_jul22_pr.pdf.\nPharmacy providers must comply with NYS Medicaid policy for 340B drug claims, as outlined in the NYRx\nthe NY Medicaid Pharmacy Program – Pharmacy Manual Policy Guidelines, located at: https://\nwww.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/Pharmacy/PDFS/Pharmacy_Policy_Guidelines.pdf, and Medicaid\nUpdate articles. All NCPDP-submitted 340B-purchased drug claims (when NYS Medicaid is primary payor)\nmust be submitted with claim level identifiers and at actual acquisition cost. Providers should refer to the\nNYRx the NY Medicaid Pharmacy Program – Pharmacy Manual Policy Guidelines, located at: https://\nwww.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/Pharmacy/PDFS/Pharmacy_Policy_Guidelines.pdf, for requirements\nwhen NYS Medicaid is secondary payor. Claim level identifiers are required on eligible 340B purchased drug\nclaims for NYS Medicaid members.\nThrough monitoring real-time claims, NYRx has identified two trends in pharmacy submitted 340B\ndrug claims:\n1. Ingredient cost submitted exceeds 340B ceiling price\n2. Invalid codes submitted for 340B pharmacy drugs\nThe 340B ceiling price refers to the maximum amount that a manufacturer can charge the covered entity for\nthe purchase of a 340B drug. A claim submitted to NYS Medicaid that is higher than the 340B ceiling price\nwill be denied. Claims that are denied must be resubmitted with the correct ingredient cost. Alternatively, the\npharmacy may dispense a non-340B drug and remove the claim level identifiers and submit at the usual and\ncustomary charge.\nClaims for 340B drugs submitted to NYS Medicaid via the NCPDP D.0 format must also adhere to the\nfollowing:\n• must be properly identified as 340B for both fee-for-service (FFS) members and Medicaid Managed\nCare (MMC) enrollees; and\n• submitted at the 340B acquisition cost by invoice to the provider for FFS members and MMC enrollees,\nnet any manufacturer discounts and/or other price reductions.\nContinued on Page 3\n\nKathy Hochul\nGovernor\nState of New York\nJames McDonald, M.D., M.P.H.\nCommissioner\nNew York State\nDepartment of Health\nAmir Bassiri\nMedicaid Director\nOffice of Health Insurance Programs\nThe Medicaid Update is a monthly publication of the New York State Department of Health.\nIn This Issue…\nReminder: Pharmacies Submitting Medicaid 340B Drug Claims ...............................................................................
