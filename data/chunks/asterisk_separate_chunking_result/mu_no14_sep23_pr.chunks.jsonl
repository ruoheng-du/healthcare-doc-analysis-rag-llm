In accordance with NYS Education Law, unlicensed interns,\nresidents, and foreign physicians participating in training programs, are authorized to prescribe.

Unlicensed interns, residents, and foreign physicians in training programs.\n2. Out-of-state (OOS) licensed prescribers that are treating NYS Medicaid members for a single\ninstance of emergency care within 180 days. These prescribers must be either enrolled in Medicare\nwith an “approved” status or enrolled in a Medicaid plan in their own state.\nPharmacies will receive a reject code/POS rejection message for prescriptions written by a non-enrolled\nprescriber.

When a non-hospice provider offers services to a\nrecipient in hospice, the non-hospice provider should request and consult the DOH-5778 form to ascertain if\nnon-allowable duplication of services would occur or if the service or supply is for a condition other than the\nhospice diagnosis. For additional information regarding hospice services, providers should refer to the\neMedNY “Hospice Manual” web page, located at: https://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/Hospice/\nindex.aspx.\nPurpose of RR/E Code C2\nVerification of eligibility through the ePACES section of eMedNY will indicate a RR/E code, C2-HOSPICE-\nMM, that identifies NYS Medicaid members who have opted to enroll in the hospice program.\nFor dual-eligible members (in receipt of both Medicare and NYS Medicaid) who have enrolled in the hospice\nprogram, NYS DOH will use a file supplied by Medicare to load the RR/E code C2 in eMedNY on the members\nNYS Medicaid record.\nFor non-dual NYS Medicaid members, RR/E code C2 will be manually added to the record of the NYS\nMedicaid member by NYS DOH upon receipt of the Hospice Care Recipient Restriction/Exception (RR/E)\nCode Update Form, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/redesign/mrt90/mltc\n_policy/2023/docs/att1.pdf, from an LDSS, MMCO, or hospice provider. If a NYS Medicaid member in\nreceipt of hospice services elects to discontinue hospice services, RR/E code C2 must be manually\nclosed by NYS DOH.\nDue to limitations of data received from Medicare, NYS Medicaid members no longer in receipt of hospice\ncare will need to have RR/E code C2 manually closed with a manually entered end-date. Changes to a\nmembers RR/E code C2 status can be made by emailing the completed Hospice Care Recipient\nRestriction/Exception (RR/E) Code Update Form, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care\n/medicaid/redesign/mrt90/mltc_policy/2023/docs/att1.pdf, to hospicebilling@health.ny.gov.\nSeptember 2023 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 4\n\nBilling Edit for Rate Codes Not Covered in Conjunction with Hospice\nA new edit (“02328”) has been implemented in the eMedNY system for NYS Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS)\nclaims to recognize RR/E code C2 and prevent payment for the services/programs shown below, which are\nnot covered while enrolled in hospice.\nThe following codes are not payable with RR/E code C2 present on the record of the NYS Medicaid member.\nIf a NYS Medicaid member has RR/E code C2 on any service date submitted during the active hospice\nenrollment and one of these rate codes is billed, the claim will be denied for the “02328” edit.\nService/Program"}

The\ndaily dispensing logs must bear the initials of the dispensing pharmacist(s). All records supporting\nNYS Medicaid payments must be maintained for six years.\nPlease note: Enrolled pharmacy providers continue to be subject to any additional record\nretention requirements outlined in their prior or current contracts with Medicaid Managed Care\n(MMC) or Managed Long Term Care (MLTC) or Subcontractors thereof, including retention for\n10 years or more as delineated therein. Other reminders can be found in the Pharmacy\nProgram Integrity Spotlight article published in the June 2023 issue of the Medicaid Update,\nlocated at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2023/docs/mu\n_no11_jun23_pr.pdf.\n• Prescription claiming – Auto-refilling is not allowed. Claims for prescriptions billed to NYS Medicaid\nthat are not delivered to or picked up by the recipient within 14 days must be reversed and drug product\nreturned to stock or returned through an authorized reverse distributor.\nThe best way pharmacy providers can prepare for a pharmacy CVR is by ensuring they remain knowledgeable\nof current and applicable NYS Medicaid program requirements, evaluating operational procedures regularly\nfor compliance with those requirements, and correcting areas of non-compliance in a timely manner. For up-\nto-date pharmacy policy and billing communications or to sign up for the eMedNY LISTSERV, providers\nshould visit the eMedNY “Pharmacy Manual” web page, located at: https://www.emedny.org/Provider\nManuals/Pharmacy/index.aspx.
