SPA #99-39 requires Tribal 638 outpatient facilities to be paid using the outpatient\nper visit rate. IHS clinics are reimbursed at an all-inclusive threshold rate for all medical or behavioral health\nservices provided to NYS Medicaid members during qualifying threshold visits. The all-inclusive threshold rate\nincludes all facility and professional fees associated with the services rendered. Providers can refer to the\nFederal Register notice, published on April 8, 2022 by the Indian Health Service, at:\nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/04/08/2022-07468/reimbursement-rates-for-calendar-year-\n2022, for more information.\nAll medical services provided in a tribal clinic rendered to NYS Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) members\nshould be billed to NYS Medicaid using the all-inclusive “1610” threshold rate code. It is advised to use AIR\ncode “1610” for services rendered to both American Indians/American Natives (AIs/ANs) and non-AIs/ANs.\nFor all services rendered by clinics licensed by the NYS Office of Mental Health (OMH) or NYS Office of\nAddiction Services and Supports (OASAS) to NYS Medicaid FFS members, use the following all-inclusive\nrate codes:\n• “1907” – OMH (AIR)\n• “1908” – OASAS (AIR)\nPlease note: The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe is currently the only tribe assigned OMH and OASAS rate codes.\nAll medical and behavioral health services rendered by federally recognized tribal clinics designated as IHS\nproviders are exempt from the Ambulatory Patient Group (APG) reimbursement methodology and are\nreimbursed via the federal AIR. Services provided by the following practitioners/programs qualify as IHS\nthreshold visits and meet the requirements for payment of the AIR:\n• Physicians;\n• Physician Assistants (PAs);\n• Nurse Practitioners (NPs);\n• Licensed Midwives (LMs);\n• Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSWs)/Licensed Master Social Workers (LMSWs);\n• Dentists/Dental Hygienists;\n• Psychologists;\n• Optometrist/Opticians;\n• Physical Therapists (PTs)/Occupational Therapists (OTs)/Speech-Language Pathologists\n(SLPs);\n• Podiatrists;\n• Registered Dietitians, Registered Nurses (RNs), Pharmacists, Respiratory Therapists [AIR\nreimbursement limited to only those providing diabetes self-management training (DSMT) and\nasthma self-management training (ASMT)];\n• OMH Article 31 Licensed Clinics;\n• OASAS Article 32 Certified Outpatient Programs; and\n• OASAS Article 32 Opioid Treatment Programs.\nPlease note: If a NYS Medicaid member is seen for both medical and behavioral health services on the\nsame date of service, two separate claims may be billed one for the medical services with rate code “1610”\nand a second claim for the behavioral health services using the appropriate OMH/OASAS rate codes shown\nabove.\nOctober 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 4\n\nMedicaid Managed Care (MMC) Plans are required to pay IHS providers at least the federal AIR for all\nqualifying threshold visits for both AIs/ANs and non-AIs/ANs. MMC Plans have been directed to identify all\nclaims that were reimbursed at less than the IHS AIR that require an adjustment and to automatically\nreprocess claims to pay the full AIR retroactively back to April 1, 2020.\nThe eMedNY system has been modified to reimburse all Medicaid FFS IHS claims to the federal AIR.\nAdditionally, effective April 1, 2020, all MMC Plans are required to pay IHS providers their applicable\nencounter rate published annually in the Federal Register by the IHS. Effective April 1, 2020, tribal IHS\nclinics no longer need to submit Medicaid FFS claims (rate code “7827”) to seek supplemental wrap\npayments under the Supplemental Payment Program, as MMC Plans are required to pay the full federal AIR.\nTo ensure that tribal IHS clinics have been properly paid, DOH will systematically identify any FFS claims with\nservice dates on or after April 1, 2020, that were reimbursed less than the IHS AIR and will automatically\nreprocess those claims to pay the full AIR. IHS providers do not need to resubmit any claims.\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• FFS claim questions should be directed to the eMedNY Call Center at (800) 343-9000.\n• FFS coverage and policy questions should be directed to the Office of Health Insurance Programs\n(OHIP) Division of Program Development and Management (DPDM) by telephone at (518) 473-2160\nor by email at FFSMedicaidPolicy@health.ny.gov.\n• MMC reimbursement, billing, and/or documentation requirement questions should be directed to the\nenrollee’s MMC Plan.\n• MMC Plan contact information can be found in the eMedNY New York State Medicaid Program\nInformation for All Providers – Managed Care Informat"}

These changes will recognize all values in specified\nfields and will reject or approve, per program policy, when other patient responsibility amounts are accepted,\nand other third-party insurance billing is validated when the claim is not covered. This is an update to previous\nguidance on this topic issued in the following Medicaid Update issues:\n• Update on Medicaid FFS Pharmacy Billing Instructions for Coordination of Benefits Submission article\npublished in the July 2018 issue of the Medicaid Update, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/\nhealth_care/medicaid/program/update/2018/jul18_mu.pdf; and\n• Update on Medicaid Fee-for-Service (FFS) Pharmacy Billing Instructions for Coordination of Benefits\n(COB) Submission article published in the July 2017 issue of the Medicaid Update, located at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2017/jul17_mu.pdf.\nOctober 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 6\n\nCoordination of Benefits (COB) ensures the correct party pays first. NYS Medicaid is always the payor of\nlast resort; federal regulations require that all other available resources be used before NYS Medicaid\nconsiders payment. If there is a responsible third-party that should be paying for the health benefits of the\npatient such as a health insurance provider, the responsible third-party should pay first. NYS Medicaid pays\nthe lesser of Patient Responsibility (PR) or the NYS Medicaid fee, regardless of the PR amount. For\npharmacies, this rule applies to all PR, which includes deductible, co-insurance, copay, and other patient\nresponsibility.\nEffective November 1, 2022, NYS Medicaid will not accept a combination of Other Coverage Code of\n\"3\" in National Council for Prescription Drug Program (NCPDP) field 308-C8 (Other Coverage Code)\nwith any reject code in field 472-6E when another third party is responsible for payment. The pre-\nadjudication edit will be expanded for this field and will return the NCPDP Reject Code (DE 3988) (6E - M/I\nOther Payer Reject Code).\nThe provider must work with the primary insurance to obtain coverage for the member. This could\ninvolve prior authorization (PA) requirements, appeal processes, or changes to medications ordered\nto align with the primary plan formulary products, etc. Providers should refer to the Reminder: Pharmacy\nBilling for Medicaid Patients with other Coverage article published in the November 2021 issue of the Medicaid\nUpdate, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2021/docs/mu_no13_\nnov21_pr.pdf, for more information regarding this topic. If all attempts for coverage have been exhausted and\ncoverage has not been granted from the primary insurer, NYS DOH may consider the denial under special\ncircumstances. The medication in question would still be subject to any editing requirements under the NYS\nMedicaid FFS program. Submitting Third Party Liability (TPL) -covered claims that incorrectly bypass the TPL\nPlan responsibility of payment is considered inaccurate billing and may be subject to audit recoveries.\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• All questions regarding this update should be directed to the Medicaid Pharmacy Policy Unit by\ntelephone at (518) 486-3209 or by email at NYRx@health.ny.gov.\n• FFS claim questions, COB billing questions, or any billing issue should be directed to the eMedNY\nCall Center at (800) 343-9000.\n"}
