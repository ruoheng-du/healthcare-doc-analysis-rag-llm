NYS Medicaid is always the payer of last resort. Federal regulations require\nthat all other available resources be used before NYS Medicaid considers payment. Through coordination of\nbenefits (COB), NYS Medicaid will pay the patient responsibility for correctly submitted NYS Medicaid\ncoverable claims, up to the NYS Medicaid allowed amount.\nProviders must exhaust all existing benefits prior to billing the NYS Medicaid. Providers should always ask a\nNYS Medicaid member if they have other third-party coverage to ensure the proper COB. Pharmacies are\nresponsible for submitting claims to other coverage before submitting claims to NYS Medicaid. Pharmacies\nare required to coordinate with the proper primary payer. This includes submitting a claim under the\nappropriate coverage benefit, medical or pharmacy.\nCertain services may be rejected by the primary payer, but coverage should still be pursued in\nsituations including, but not limited to:\n• prior authorization (PA) needs to be obtained from the primary payer;\n• billing Medicare Part D for services covered by Medicare Part B, or billing Medicare Part B for services\ncovered by Medicare Part D and getting a rejection;\n• submitting to the wrong third-party causing claims to bypass incorrectly (third-party claims that\nincorrectly bypass the primary plan responsibility of payment is considered inaccurate billing and may\nbe subject to audit recoveries);\n• billing the appropriate benefit (medical versus pharmacy);\n• billing of the appropriate service code [National Drug Code (NDC) versus Healthcare Common\nProcedure Coding System (HCPCS) code];\n• the pharmacy is not contracted with the primary payer of the NYS Medicaid member; and\n• resolve by obtaining an override or enroll with the Third-Party Liability (TPL) or advise the NYS\nMedicaid member and prescriber of the need to change dispensing to a network pharmacy.\nPharmacies that have difficulty billing primary insurance for the above situations, should advise prescribers\nand NYS Medicaid members of potential delays as well as options for resolution. If claim issues are resolved,\nthe pharmacies may then resubmit the claims to NYS Medicaid after the claims are properly adjudicated with\nthe primary payer.\nReminder\nProviders must maintain evidence and documentation, which are subject to audit, for a minimum of six years\nfollowing the date of NYS Medicaid payment. This evidence should include, but not be limited to, denials of\nclaims by responsible TPL plans, other applicable TPL plan responses, and payment information. Prescribers\nare responsible for prescribing, per plan formulary, and to pursue any claim issues such as, but not limited to:\n• necessary PAs or appeals;\n• prescription alternatives (for a non-formulary or non-preferred drug);\n• necessary changes (quantity supply, day supply, etc.); and\n• selection of an in-network pharmacy that is agreeable to the NYS Medicaid member.\nIf following the values are not reported correctly, the claim will fail a pre-adjudication edit in National Council\nfor Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) field 340-7C with Reject Code \"7C\" (Missing/Invalid Other Payer\nID Code).
