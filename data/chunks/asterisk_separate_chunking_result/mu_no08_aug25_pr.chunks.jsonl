Some of these Medicare Advantage Plans have been using a pre-paid debit card as the\nannual dental benefit that the NYS Medicaid member can use to pay for dental services.\nThese pre-paid debit cards can be considered private pay agreements with the provider until they are\nexhausted (the term private pay is being used in this instance “only for billing purposes” and under no\ncircumstances does it reflect the out-of-pocket expenses by NYS Medicaid members). The fee that the\nprovider charges for their service while using the pre-paid debit card is not subject to NYS Medicaid allowable\namounts. Once the funds on the debit card have been exhausted, the provider may bill NYS Medicaid,\nprovided that the NYS Medicaid member is eligible on the date of service. The provider must abide by NYS\nMedicaid allowable amounts for these services. If a balance remains on the debit card that does not fully\ncover the dental service provided and NYS Medicaid is secondary coverage for the NYS Medicaid member,\nthe provider should report the balance remaining from the debit card on the NYS Medicaid claim in the “Patient\nPaid Amount” field.\nProviders must keep records to identify that the payment was made by the pre-paid debit card and not cash,\nif the dental service provided is a NYS Medicaid-covered service. NYS Medicaid will pay the difference\nbetween the dollar amount reported in the “Patient Paid Amount” field and the NYS Medicaid fee. The claim\nmust be submitted electronically using payer code “16” and the provider should zero fill the Part C payment\nin the “Coordination of Benefits” section. Partial payments are still subject to prior approval as specified in\nexisting NYS Medicaid policy.\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• NYS Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) coverage and policy questions should be directed to the Office of\nHealth Insurance Programs Division of Program Development and Management by telephone at\n(518) 473-2160 or by email at dentalpolicy@health.ny.gov.\n• NYS Medicaid FFS claim questions should be directed to the eMedNY Call Center at (800) 343-9000.\n"}

There is currently one Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, Clinical\nLaboratory Improvement Amendments-waived, rapid syphilis test, Syphilis Health Check™, for the detection\nof Treponema pallidum antibodies, the bacteria that causes syphilis. If additional tests receive FDA-approval,\nthis same policy will also apply.\nAccording to NYS data, which can be found in the New York State 2023 Sexually Transmitted Infections\nSurveillance Report, located on the NYS Department of Health “Sexually Transmitted Infections Data and\nStatistics” web page, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/diseases/communicable/std/ (under the\n“Surveillance Summary Reports” section of the web page), primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis, the most\ninfectious stages of the disease, representing the newest cases reported in NYS, were almost eliminated in\nthe year 2000 when about 132 diagnoses (0.6 cases per 100,000 persons) were reported from a statewide\nhigh of 5,688 diagnoses (31.7 cases per 100,000 persons) in 1988 (a reduction of 98 percent in diagnoses\nand rate*). Since 2000, these diagnoses have been escalating rapidly, and these annual increases have been\nsustained. In 2023, 2,888 diagnoses were reported, representing a 2,087 percent increase. In 2014, the rate\nof P&S syphilis in females was 0.5 per 100,000, and in 2023, increased by 800 percent to 4.5 per 100,000.\nAs a result, congenital syphilis diagnoses have also increased from 23 in 2014 to 67 in 2023 as well as 13\nassociated deaths/stillbirths in the same period. Despite syphilis being a preventable and treatable disease,\nequitable access to screening and treatment remains a formidable barrier to reaching all populations. For this\nreason, NYS Medicaid has added coverage of POC syphilis testing. This technology has proven to advance\nhealth equity by increasing accessibility and expanding options, particularly for underserved communities\ndisproportionately affected by syphilis.\nAdditional information regarding syphilis rates in NYS can be found in the New York State 2023 Sexually\nTransmitted Infections Surveillance Report, located on the NYS Department of Health “Sexually Transmitted\nInfections Data and Statistics” web page, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/diseases/\ncommunicable/std/ (under the “Surveillance Summary Reports” section of the web page).\nFFS Reimbursement for POC Syphilis Testing\nFor NYS Medicaid FFS POC syphilis testing reimbursement, claims should be submitted using the following\nCurrent Procedural Terminology (CPT) code “86780”. If the POC syphilis test is positive, confirmatory\nserological testing must then be performed at a NYS-permitted laboratory to establish definitive diagnosis. A\nnegative result in a high-risk individual should be interpreted cautiously and repeat testing may be necessary\nif clinical suspicion remains high. This CPT code has been added to the following Fee Schedules:\n• NYS Medicaid Physician Medicine Services Fee Schedule, located on the eMedNY “Physician\nManual” web page at: https://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/Physician/ (under the “Procedure\nCodes & Fee Schedules” section, then select Fee Schedules: Medicine)\n• NYS Medicaid Nurse Practitioner Fee Schedule, located on the eMedNY “Nurse Practitioner Manual”\nweb page at: https://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/NursePractitioner/ (select Fee Schedule).\n• NYS Medicaid Midwife Fee Schedule, located on the eMedNY “Midwife Manual” web page at:\nhttps://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/Midwife/ (select Fee Schedule).\nAugust 2025 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 5\n\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• NYS Medicaid FFS coverage and policy questions should be directed to the Office of Health Insurance\nPrograms Division of Program Development and Management by telephone at (518) 473-2160 or by\nemail at FFSMedicaidPolicy@health.ny.gov.\n• MMC reimbursement, billing, and/or documentation requirement questions should be directed to the\nMMC Plan of the enrollee.

The FFS APG weight for APG\n168 (dialysis) has increased from 1.3651 to 1.5302.
