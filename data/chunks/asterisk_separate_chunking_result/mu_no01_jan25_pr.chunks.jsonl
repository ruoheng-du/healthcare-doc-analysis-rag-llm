These guidelines are intended to standardize the decision-making process and promote\nconsistent application of inpatient admission criteria across health care facilities.\nProviders may encounter cases where patients require hospital care but do not meet inpatient admission\ncriteria. It is essential to distinguish between formal inpatient admission, which is based on a documented\nmedical order, and placement into observation status, as this distinction significantly impacts billing, and NYS\nMedicaid claim processing and payment.\nInpatient Admission Requirements\nNYS Medicaid generally follows the Two-Midnight Rule used by Medicare, which deems inpatient admission\nappropriate when the patient is expected to need hospital care for at least two midnights, ensuring that\nadmission is medically necessary, and that care cannot be provided in an outpatient setting. For an inpatient\nadmission order to be valid, it must be signed, before admission, by a physician directly involved with the care\nof the patient. This involvement must be documented with signed notes showing the physician examined the\npatient, contributed to the care plan, and engaged in medical decision-making. The order must be completed\nby a qualified physician (the “ordering practitioner”) who:\n• holds admitting privileges at the specific hospital, and\n• is familiar with the condition of the patient, treatment plan, and hospital needs at the time of admission.\nThe admission decision should be based on a comprehensive assessment, supported by documentation that\nreflects the need for inpatient care, such as continuous monitoring or intensive treatment. If the anticipated\nstay is less than two midnights, observation status should be considered, as it applies when the needs of the\npatient are expected to resolve within a shorter timeframe and do not warrant inpatient admission.\nTwo-Midnight Rule Exceptions\nCertain circumstances may justify inpatient admission even if the patient does not meet the two-midnight rule.\nThese exceptions include:\n• departure Against Medical Advice (AMA),\n• rapid clinical improvement,\n• transfer to another facility, and\n• patient death.\nContinued on Page 3\n\n[OCR Supplement]\nyew | Department\nstare | of Health\nMedicaid Update\n\nThe Official Newsletter of the New York State Medicaid Program\n\nKathy Hochul\nGovernor\nState of New York\nJames McDonald, M.D., M.P.H.\nCommissioner\nNew York State\nDepartment of Health\nAmir Bassiri\nMedicaid Director\nOffice of Health Insurance Programs\nThe Medicaid Update is a monthly publication of the New York State Department of Health.\nIn This Issue…\nInpatient Admission and Observation Policy for New York State Medicaid Providers ...............................................

If the condition of the patient requires extended hospital care, a decision to admit as an inpatient\nshould be made. Observation status is intended for cases where it is initially unclear whether inpatient\nadmission is necessary or if the patient may be safely discharged.\nObservation status does not require an inpatient admission order. Instead, a physician or qualified practitioner\nplaces the patient in observation to assess the need for inpatient care. Documentation should indicate the\nneed for ongoing monitoring, evaluation, or additional testing to support this determination. Additional\ninformation can be found in the Direct Omit for Observation Services article published in the August 2016\nissue of the Medicaid Update, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program\n/update/2016/aug16_mu.pdf.\nUtilization Review\nHospitals must be diligent in their review of inpatient admissions to ensure compliance with NYS Medicaid\nbilling policies and the medical necessity requirements for inpatient claims. This involves thoroughly\nevaluating whether the medical factors documented in the medical record support the appropriateness of the\ninpatient admission, the duration of the stay and the professional services, including drugs and biologicals.\nUtilization review teams play a critical role in verifying that these criteria are met before submitting a claim to\nNYS Medicaid. All supporting documentation must be retained for ten years from the date of payment and\nmade available upon request to substantiate the claim during post-payment reviews.\nProvider Responsibilities\nTo comply with NYS Medicaid billing policies, providers must ensure their staff have a thorough understanding\nof billing requirements for inpatient admissions and observation status. Ongoing staff education, routine\ninternal audits, and regular evaluations of billing practices and workflows are critical for identifying and\nresolving gaps in compliance, documentation accuracy, and adherence to NYS Medicaid policies. By\nimplementing these measures, providers can ensure inpatient claim submissions meet NYS Medicaid\nstandards and strengthen utilization review processes.\nJanuary 2025 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 3\n\n[OCR Supplement]\nAll Providers\nAll Providers |\nAll Providers\n\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• Fee-for-service (FFS) claim questions should be directed to the eMedNY Call Center at (800) 343-\n9000.\n• FFS coverage and policy questions should be directed to the Office of Health Insurance Programs\nDivision of Program Development and Management by telephone at (518) 473-2160 or by email at\nFFSMedicaidPolicy@health.ny.gov.\n• Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) reimbursement, billing, and/or documentation requirement questions\nshould be directed to the MMC Plan of the enrollee.

For example,\nalternatives to oxymetazoline or phenylephrine may include other decongestants or nasal\ncorticosteroids that offer more effective long-term management of nasal congestion.\n• Patient Education: NYRx will notify NYS Medicaid members of these changes. Additionally, provider\neducation to patients about these formulary changes is helpful and may provide available alternatives.\nEnsuring that patients understand the rationale behind these changes and the benefits of alternative\ntherapies is essential for a smooth transition.\n• Adjusting Prescribing Practices: Given these changes, providers may need to modify their\nprescribing practices. Staying informed about which medications remain covered and considering the\nmost appropriate therapies for patient needs will be crucial.\nNYRx is committed to continuously monitoring medication utilization and effectiveness to ensure that the OTC\nformulary remains aligned with evidence-based practices.\nQuestions\nQuestions regarding this policy should be directed to NYRx@health.ny.gov.\n"}

As\npreviously stated in past Medicaid Update articles, including in the Medicaid Pharmacy List of Reimbursable\nDrugs article published in the June 2020 issue of the Medicaid Update, located at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2020/docs/mu_no11_jun20.pdf. The list\ncan be searched and sorted by National Drug Code (NDC), as well as description, drug type, labeler, cost,\nprior authorization (PA) code, or over-the-counter (OTC) indicator.\nOnly those prescription and non-prescription drugs, which appear on the list, with their 11-digit NDCs, are\nreimbursable under NYRx. The list also contains those non-prescription therapeutic categories, which the\nCOH has specified as essential in meeting the medical needs of NYS Medicaid members.\nJanuary 2025 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 11\n\nDrug Coverage Limitations\nNYS Medicaid only provides reimbursement for drugs included on the New York State Department of Health\nList of Medicaid Reimbursable Drugs, located at: https://www.emedny.org/info/formfile.aspx (unless provided\nby a facility which includes the cost of drugs in their all-inclusive rate). The following are examples of\ndrugs/drug uses which are not reimbursable by NYS Medicaid, in accordance with policy and/or state or\nfederal legislation:\n• Drugs used for the treatment of anorexia, weight loss or weight gain pursuant to Social Security Act\n(SSA) §1927(d)(2), located at: https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title19/1927.htm.\n• Drugs for the treatment of sexual dysfunction pursuant to SSA §1927(d)(2), located at: https://\nwww.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title19/1927.htm, and Social Services Law (SOS) §365-a(4)(f), located\nat: https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/SOS/365-A.\n• Drugs without a federal rebate agreement or a rebate agreement with a State authorized by the\nSecretary pursuant to SSA §1927(a), located at: https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title19\n/1927.htm.\n• Drugs indicated for cosmetic use or hair growth pursuant to SSA §1927(d)(2), located at: https://\nwww.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title19/1927.htm.\n• Any contrast agents, used for radiological testing (these are included in the fee of the radiologist).\n• Drugs packaged in unit doses for which bulk product exists.\nClaims Processing\nPharmacy claims submitted for medications that are not active on the New York State Department of Health\nList of Medicaid Reimbursable Drugs, located at: https://www.emedny.org/info/formfile.aspx, will be rejected\nwith targeted National Council for Prescription Drug Programs (NCPDP) messaging. Rejection messaging\nhas recently been updated to provide additional detail regarding coverage criteria. Reject messages are\nreturned via NCPDP field 511-FB: Reject Code. Additionally, the Medicaid Eligibility Verification System\n(MEVS) Denial Code for a transaction is returned within the additional message information 526-FQ and\nindicates the MEVS error for rejected transactions.\nClaim Edit Details\nIn an effort to help pharmacies better understand why a claim is rejecting, the NYS Department of Health has\nenhanced its current editing for products not covered by the NYRx. This enhancement created four new edits\nin addition to our existing two edits, to further specifically message why a product is not covered. The following\ninformation provides more detail of these changes.\nDrugs Without Federal Rebate Agreement\nPursuant to SSA §1927(a), located at: https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title19/1927.htm, drug\nmanufacturers are required to participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) for coverage. NDCs\nof non-participants will reject with the NCPDP reject message provided below.
