Pharmacies providing services\nto FFS and MMC members should be aware, prepared, and ready to bill FFS or MMC for these services for\nmembers. It is unacceptable to turn a member away due to a pharmacy’s inexperience with billing this benefit or\nsoftware issues with billing (see below).\nIn accordance with Title 18 of New York Codes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR) §505.3, non-prescription (OTC)\nemergency contraceptive drugs can be obtained without a written order from a practitioner.\nEffective March 1, 2017 per Federal Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines, New York State Medicaid has\neliminated age restrictions when dispensing non-prescription emergency contraceptive drugs without a written\norder. Prescription-only emergency contraceptive drugs continue to require a prescription.

For Medicaid FFS enrollees, the 12-month benefit year begins on April\n1st of each year and runs through March 31st of the following year. For MMC enrollees, the 12-month benefit year\nis per calendar year, beginning January 1st of each year and runs through December 31st of the same year.\nThere has been no change to the occupational therapy and speech therapy benefits. Coverage of occupational\nand speech therapy will remain capped at 20 visits per therapy type each year.

The modifier identifies the therapy type and provides a\nmechanism for counting and matching. Without a modifier, the claim will be denied.\n“GN” – speech therapy service\n“GO” – occupational therapy service\n“GP” – physical therapy service\n• Medicaid FFS utilizes the prior authorization (PA) mechanism to track therapy visits. A PA must be obtained\nfor each therapy visit for enrollees not exempt from the limitation. The PA number must be included on the\nclaim at the time of submission. If no PA number is on the claim and one is required, the claim will be\ndenied. PA must be obtained through the PA/Dispensing Validation System (DVS). A unique PA number\nmust be obtained through the DVS for each visit. The DVS operates on “real-time” and will give an\nimmediate response to a request for PA. A DVS authorization does not guarantee payment. However,\nwithout a PA the claim will be denied. A request for a PA should be submitted before the provision of service.\nThe request may be made after the date of the service and can be approved if the enrollee has not already\nApril 2019 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 4\n\nbeen authorized for the maximum number of visits. A maximum of 20 prior authorization numbers will be\nissued for occupational therapy, 20 for speech therapy, and 40 for physical therapy. Further instructions on\nobtaining a DVS authorization number can be accessed online at: https://www.emedny.org/\nselfhelp/ePACES/ePACESRefSheets.aspx.\n• Failing to obtain rehabilitation therapy PA prior to or on the date of service puts the provider's\nreimbursement at risk. It is important for the provider to know how many of the rehabilitation therapy visits\nan enrollee has already used because Medicaid will only pay for 20 occupational therapy visits, 20 speech\ntherapy visits, and 40 physical therapy visits per benefit year for each member that is not exempt.\nAdditional information may be found in the Rehabilitation Services Manual online at:\nhttps://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/RehabilitationSrvcs/index.aspx.

Chlamydia, a\nvery common STI, is the most frequently reported communicable disease in New York State (NYS) with over\n116,000 diagnoses last year. Chlamydia is a leading cause of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), ectopic\npregnancy, and infertility. Many people experience multiple episodes of chlamydia reinfection soon after\ntreatment because they were reinfected by a partner who had an undiagnosed chlamydia infection. Recent data\nindicate that at least 12 percent of New Yorkers diagnosed with chlamydia are re-diagnosed with a new\nchlamydia infection within one year of treatment.\nWhile the potential long-term consequences for untreated chlamydia can be serious, this STI is easily curable\nfor most people. Expedited Partner Therapy (EPT) is the legal clinical practice of providing individuals with\nantibiotics (or a prescription for antibiotics) to deliver to their sexual partners as presumptive treatment for\nchlamydia, without completing a clinical assessment of those partners. The New York State Department of\nHealth (NYSDOH) strongly encourages providers to utilize EPT. The Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC), along with the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), American Medical\nAssociation (AMA), American Bar Association, and Society for Adolescent Medicine are among several national\nprofessional organizations that recommend EPT as an effective and practical strategy for treating the sex\npartners of people diagnosed with chlamydia. 1,2,3,4,5 Randomized controlled trials have found that this strategy\ndecreases rates of chlamydia reinfection among index patients and increases the proportion of sex partner(s)\nreported to be treated for chlamydia.6,7\nImportant Information and Considerations:\n• EPT for chlamydia is authorized under New York Codes, Rules, and Regulations (NYCRR) §23.5, of Title\n10, and §2312 of NYS Public Health Law.8,9 Health care providers or pharmacists who administer EPT in\naccordance with this law are not subject to civil or criminal liability and will not be deemed to have engaged\nin professional misconduct as a result of this strategy.\n• EPT prescriptions are currently waived from the NYS electronic prescription (“e-prescribe”) mandate. A\nblanket waiver letter of the electronic prescribing requirements is available at: https://www.health.ny.\ngov/professionals/narcotic/electronic_prescribing/docs/2019-02-21_blanket_waiver_letter.pdf.\nApril 2019 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 5\n\n• Paper prescriptions may be used for EPT. Providers may order prescription pads at: https://www.health\n.ny.gov/forms/doh-250. If providing a paper prescription for EPT the prescription needs to include:\nThe designation “EPT” must be written in the body of the prescription form above the name\nof the medication and dosage for all prescriptions issued.\nIf the sex partner’s name, address, and date of birth are not available, the written\ndesignation “EPT” shall be sufficient for the pharmacist to fill the prescription (see example\nimage).\nIf the name, address, and date of birth of the sex partner are available, this information\nshould be written in the designated area of the prescription form.\nExample image of how to fill out an EPT paper prescription when there is no patient name and address\navailable.\n• Medication costs for Medicaid patients are a covered service and may be billed to the Program by the\ndispensing pharmacy. Medication costs for the sex partner may be self-pay (paid by the person who picks\nup the prescription) or paid by the sex partner’s health insurance. Alternatively, the provider may choose to\ndirectly dispense medications to both patients and partners at no cost instead of writing a prescription.\n• EPT medication may be provided directly to the patient to deliver to their sex partner(s). This approach is\npreferred to a written prescription, especially for the adolescent population, because prescriptions may\nintroduce barriers to accessing EPT such as transportation, cost, and/or confidentiality. Providing\nmedication directly to the index patient may also be more convenient for providers.\n• As stated in NYCRR §23.5, health education materials must accompany EPT (medication or prescription).\nEPT health education materials may be ordered from NYSDOH at https://www.health.ny.gov/forms/order_\nforms/ept.htm.\n• The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene also produces EPT-related health education\nmaterials which are available at: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/providers/health-topics/expedited-partner-\ntherapy.page.\nApril 2019 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 6\n\n• Severe adverse reactions such as anaphylaxis are extremely rare with azithromycin. Milder side effects\nthat may impact the success of treatment, including nausea and vomiting, occur in fewer than five percent\nof patients.10\n• EPT should not b"}

Treatment for chlamydia alone is not adequate to treat these other\ninfections.\n• EPT may not be clinically appropriate for every patient. For example, EPT is not recommended for gay,\nbisexual, and other men who have sex with men due to the lack of study data on EPT’s effectiveness in\nthis population and the risk of STI/HIV co-infection among partners. 11\nAdditional EPT guidelines, resources, and information are available at: https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/\ncommunicable/std/ept/index.htm.\nReferences:\n1.
