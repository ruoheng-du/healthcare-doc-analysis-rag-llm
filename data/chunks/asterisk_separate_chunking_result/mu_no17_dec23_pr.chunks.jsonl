This article clarifies this\ncoverage. Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC, is the cause\nof approximately three percent (one in 30) of cases of colorectal cancer. Patients identified with Lynch\nsyndrome have an increased risk for developing colorectal and extracolonic cancers in a variety of tissues\nbefore 50 years of age. This genetic condition is usually caused by an inherited mutation in a DNA MMR\ngene. First degree relatives of an individual positive for an MMR mutation have a 50 percent chance of\ninheriting the mutation. Approximately 70 percent of individuals affected by Lynch syndrome have mutations\nin the MLH1 or MSH2 gene.

An annual ACEs screening will be covered, as determined appropriate\nand medically necessary.\nACEs are strongly related to brain development and a wide range of health problems throughout the lifetime\nof an individual. ACEs have been associated with chronic conditions in adulthood, such as obesity, cancer,\ndepression, and substance misuse. Positive Childhood Experiences (PCEs) are protective factors and can\nmitigate ACEs and promote resiliency. A critically important component of screening includes conversations\nwith youth and caregivers in identifying PCEs to build resilience. NYS Medicaid recommends integrating\nprotective factors into ACEs screening.\nACEs are categorized into three experience groups: abuse, neglect, and household challenges. These\ninclude emotional, physical, and sexual abuse; emotional and physical neglect; and household challenges\nthat include exposure to domestic violence, a family member with household substance abuse, a family\nmember with mental illness, an incarcerated household member, or parental separation or divorce.\nACEs screening should take place in the context of trauma-informed care to ensure a safe, empowering\nenvironment for the child and family. Trauma-informed care enables responsiveness to specific ACE(s) of a\nchild by enhancing prevention education and activities, such as recommended treatment interventions and\nconnections to community supports and services, as guided by the interests and needs of the child and family.\nScreening for ACEs is always voluntary, to minimize the risk of retraumatizing the individual/family.\nParents/caregivers should complete the ACEs screening on behalf of children under 13 years of age.\nEligible providers are licensed or unlicensed individuals under the supervision of a licensed provider, with\ntraining and experience using the screening tools and delivery of trauma-informed care. Providers conducting\nthe screening must use a research-based screening tool to assess the exposure to adversity and factors that\ninfluence risk for associated negative outcomes of the child. Providers and practice sites should consider\nwhich screening/assessment tool to use, who should administer the tool and how, and which NYS Medicaid\nmembers should be screened. NYS Medicaid also recommends integrating screening for protective factors\nas a component of ACEs screening. Suggested screening tools and guidance are shown below.\nSpecific ACEs do not need to be recorded; however, identification of the screening tool and positive or\nnegative result must be documented. Following administration, the provider reviews the screen results along\nwith the patient and parent/caregiver history. If the screen is determined to be positive for ACEs, based on\nprovider discretion, the provider must consider the factors that influence the risk of the child for associated\nnegative outcomes, along with PCEs, and develop a treatment plan in partnership with the patient or\nparent/caregiver. Medical practices should ensure that they have the capacity to evaluate and treat children\nwho screen positive for ACEs before implementing standardized screening. Providers are expected to make\nreferrals to appropriate resources, such as mental health providers or community-based organizations, for\nany needs identified or requested as the result of the screening.\nDecember 2023 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 13\n\nACEs Screening Tool Examples\nUse of a research-based tool is required when screening for ACEs to be eligible for NYS Medicaid\nreimbursement. Health care practices should adopt the tool that meets the needs of their population and\nclinical workflow. Examples of recommended screening tools include:\n• modified ACEs questionnaire based on the original Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n(CDC)-Kaiser Permanente ACEs study (providers should refer to 1 and 2 of the “References” section\nbelow);\n• part 1 of the Pediatric ACEs and Related Life Events Screener (PEARLS) – Child tool, located at:\nhttps://www.acesaware.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/PEARLS-Tool-Child-Parent-Caregiver-\nReport-De-Identified-English.pdf, for individuals zero to 19 years of age, to be completed by the\nparent/caregiver or by the youth based on the age of the patient (providers should refer to 2 of the\n“References” section below); and\n• Adverse Childhood Experiences Questionnaire for Adults, located at: https://www.acesaware.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2022/07/ACE-Questionnaire-for-Adults-Identified"}
