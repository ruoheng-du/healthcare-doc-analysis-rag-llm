CARCs are essential\nfor NYS Medicaid to accurately process claims and determine the correct payment amount. Without the\ncorrect CARC, claims may be miscalculated, potentially resulting in NYS Medicaid overpayments or\nunderpayments.\nRequirement to Bill Primary Insurance, Even If Not Enrolled\nProviders who are not enrolled with a primary insurance payer must still attempt to submit the claim to that\nprimary insurer before billing NYS Medicaid. This process is crucial for NYS Medicaid as payer of last resort\nand ensures compliance with third-party liability rules. A formal denial from the primary insurer serves as\nrequired documentation to support the NYS Medicaid claim and provides a clear audit trail.\nNovember 2024 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 5\n\nIf the primary payer issues a CARC with the denial, providers should include this code in their electronic\nsubmission to NYS Medicaid, as CARCs are essential for accurate claims processing and helps prevent\nincorrect payment. If the primary payer will not accept or adjudicate a claim from a non-participating provider,\nthe provider is required to retain clear evidence that the claim submission was first attempted with the primary\npayer.\nHandling Zero-Fill Claims\nFor any claim submitted to NYS Medicaid as a zero fill, the provider must retain documentation that clearly\ndemonstrates the claim was first submitted to the primary payer. This documentation is essential to confirm\nthat all other payment sources were exhausted before billing NYS Medicaid, which aligns with the NYS\nMedicaid payer-of-last-resort policy.\nProviders must maintain documentation demonstrating that the services rendered are a non-covered benefit\nby the primary payer. Acceptable documentation includes a claim denial issued within the calendar/benefit\nyear of the claim, verifying that the services are not within the scope of the commercial payer coverage. This\ndocumentation may be required for submission to NYS Department of Health to ensure proper processing\nand payment of claims that were zero-filled. An exception is made for services statutorily not covered by\nMedicare; in such cases, the provider may bill NYS Medicaid directly without requiring prior submission to\nMedicare to obtain a claim denial.\nProvider Responsibilities:\n1. Identify other payers: Providers must identify all other potential payers for services rendered. This\nincludes, but is not limited to; Medicare, commercial/third-party insurance, and/or workers’\ncompensation.\n2. Bill all prior payers: Providers must bill all identified prior payers and exhaust all available coverage\noptions before submitting a claim to NYS Medicaid. Documentation of these efforts must be\nmaintained and made available upon request.\n3. Submit corrected claims: If payments are received from other payers after NYS Medicaid has\nreimbursed a claim, providers are required to submit corrected claims to NYS Medicaid and refund\nany overpayments.\nTo ensure compliance with NYS Medicaid billing policies, providers should regularly review and update their\nbilling practices This includes periodically checking for any changes in statutory non-covered services to\nconfirm that all available coverage options have been fully utilized before submitting claims to NYS Medicaid.\nProviders should review, verify, and update any non-coverage information at least annually or whenever\nsignificant payer policy changes occur. This process supports the role NYS Medicaid has as the payer of last\nresort by ensuring that only non-covered services are billed to NYS Medicaid.\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• Fee-for-service (FFS) claim questions should be directed to the eMedNY Call Center at (800) 343-\n9000.\n• FFS coverage and policy questions should be directed to the Office of Health Insurance Programs\nDivision of Program Development and Management by telephone at (518) 473-2160 or by email at\nFFSMedicaidPolicy@health.ny.gov.\n• Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) reimbursement, billing, and/or documentation requirement questions\nshould be directed to the MMC Plan of the enrollee.

New Yorkers seeking to enroll or renew their health coverage\nhad until December 15, 2024 to complete their enrollment for coverage, beginning January 1, 2025.\nNY State of Health is one of the nation’s most successful marketplaces offering public and private health\ninsurance programs, including Medicaid, Child Health Plus (CHPlus), Essential Plan (EP) – NY's Basic Health\nlook-alike program, and Qualified Health Plans (QHPs). NY State of Health certifies the health plans that offer\ncoverage, trains, and certifies enrollment assistors who help enroll consumers into coverage and provides\ncustomer service assistance to help consumers find the plan that best fits their needs and budget. Since its\nlaunch, NY State of Health has helped cut uninsured rates in half, from 10.7 percent in 2013 to 4.8\npercent in 2023 – its lowest level on record.\nThis year’s OEP comes on the heels of New York’s recently approved Innovation Waiver amendment, which\nwill save an estimated 120,000 QHP enrollees an average of $307 million in 2025. Providers should refer to\nthe State Health Department's NY State of Health Announces Approval of State's Innovation Waiver\nAmendment in Time for 2025 Enrollment Period press release, located at: https://info.nystate\nofhealth.ny.gov/news/press-release-state-health-departments-ny-state-health-announces-approval-states-\ninnovation.

Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum Plans benefits now\ninclude $0.00 out-of-pocket costs for most diabetes services, as well as $0.00 out-of-pocket costs for most\npregnancy and postpartum health services.\nThe new Silver Plans – Silver Supreme and Silver Enhanced – offer even more cost savings, including\ndiscounted cost-sharing payments, which can include deductibles, copayments, coinsurance, and expanded\neligibility for consumers with incomes of 350 percent to 400 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL).\nDetails regarding the 2025 QHP cost savings are located on the NY State of Health “Extra Cost-Savings\nThrough NY State of Health in 2025” web page, at: https://info.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/2025costsavings#\nanchor_1.\nConsumers may also be eligible for expanded EP savings for 2025. For eligible enrollees, EP offers $0.00\nmonthly premiums, and now consumers with incomes up to 250 percent of the FPL will be eligible. In addition\nto covering visits to the doctor, hospital care, screenings, prescription medicine, dental and vision benefits,\nEP benefits now include $0.00 out-of-pocket costs for pregnancy and postpartum services.
