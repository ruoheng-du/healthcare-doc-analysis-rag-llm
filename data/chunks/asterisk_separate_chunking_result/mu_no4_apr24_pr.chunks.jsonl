The CMS Final Rule requires\nMedicare-enrolled non-institutional providers and suppliers seeking to claim Medicare bad debt to enroll in a\nState’s Medicaid program for the sole purpose of receiving a zero-dollar Medicaid Remittance Advice (RA).\nTo comply with the CMS Final Rule, New York State (NYS) Medicaid has implemented two new provider\nenrollment categories of service (COS).\nBackground\n42 CFR §455.410 was amended to codify Medicare’s longstanding “must-bill” policy outlined in 42 CFR\n§413.89 – Bad debts, charity, and courtesy allowances, located at: https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-\n42/chapter-IV/subchapter-B/part-413/subpart-F/section-413.89. In the past, State Medicaid programs have\nconstrained and/or prevented enrollment of certain types of providers or suppliers that are not explicitly\nincluded in their State Plan. Medicare-enrolled provider/suppliers that are unable to enroll in a State Medicaid\nprogram cannot have their cost-sharing claims adjudicated in the State Medicaid Management Information\nSystem (MMIS) nor obtain a Medicaid RA.\nThis amendment requires the state Medicaid agency to allow enrollments of Medicare-enrolled\nproviders/suppliers meet all federal Medicaid enrollment requirements, including, but not limited to, all\napplicable provisions of 42 CFR §455, subparts B and E, located at: https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-\n42/chapter-IV/subchapter-C/part-455?toc=1, where such enrollments are solely for the purpose of processing\nclaims to determine Medicare cost-sharing, as defined in §1905(p)(3) of the Social Security Act, located at:\nhttps://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title19/1905.htm. This provision does not require States to enroll\nprovider types not recognized by their Medicaid program for purposes other than the submission of Medicare\ncost-sharing claims, adjudication of such claims, and issuance of a Medicaid RA.\nProvider Enrollment\nMedicare providers/suppliers who are only seeking a zero-dollar RA to claim Medicare bad debt must choose\nthis Medicare Cost-Sharing Only option for NYS Medicaid enrollment. This includes Medicare-enrolled\nproviders/suppliers who are currently recognized by the NYS Medicaid program (i.e., enrollable, but who wish\nto engage the NYS Medicaid program for the sole purpose of submitting claims for Medicare cost-sharing to\nobtain a zero-dollar RA).\nProviders interested in enrolling under one of the newly created COS should visit the relevant link below for\nadditional information:\n• Medicare-enrolled business/group providers or suppliers (COS “0630”): eMedNY “Provider\nEnrollment and Maintenance – Medicare Cost Sharing business” web page, located at: https://www\n.emedny.org/info/ProviderEnrollment/misc_business/.\n• Medicare-enrolled individual practitioners (COS “0631”): eMedNY “Provider Enrollment and\nMaintenance – Medicare Cost Sharing Practitioner” web page, located at: https://www.emedny\n.org/info/ProviderEnrollment/misc_practitioner/.\nPlease note: Billing, rendering/attending, and ordering/referring providers who are reported on Medicare\ncost-sharing-only claim submissions must also be enrolled in Medicaid under either a Medicare Cost-Sharing\nOnly COS or as a Medicaid provider under a COS already recognized by the State plan.\nApril 2024 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 12\n\nClaim Submission\nClaims submitted to Medicaid containing a billing provider assigned a Medicare Cost-Sharing Only COS will\nreturn a zero liability/zero payment RA back to the billing provider. Medicare must be reported as primary on\nthese claim submissions.\nQuestions and Additional Resources:\n• Fee-for-service (FFS) claims reimbursement, and/or provider enrollment questions should be directed\nto the eMedNY Call Center by telephone at (800) 343-9000 or by visiting the eMedNY homepage,\nlocated at: https://www.emedny.org/, for additional information.\n• FFS coverage and policy questions should be directed to the Office of Health Insurance Programs\n(OHIP) Division of Program Development and Management (DPDM) by telephone at (518) 473-2160\nor by email at FFSMedicaidPolicy@health.ny.gov.\n"}
