Throughout the COVID-19 PHE, NYS Medicaid\nproviders shifted traditional in person care to remote delivery, where possible. Although some barriers still\nexist and not all services are appropriate for remote delivery, telehealth has been largely beneficial in many\nservice areas. Remote services help address workforce shortages, access to specialists, infection control,\ntransportation issues, and dependent care challenges. In recognition of the changing landscape of healthcare\ndelivery and in preparation for the COVID-19 PHE unwind, the NYS Department of Health (DOH) sought\nfeedback from providers and NYS Medicaid members on their experience with telehealth to inform our post\nPHE policy.\nTo support the use of telehealth services, the NYS Medicaid program will continue to cover services delivered\nvia audio-visual telehealth, when appropriate, if such member chooses to receive telehealth services in lieu\nof an in-person visit. An audio-visual visit must contain all elements of the billable procedure codes or rate\ncodes and all required documentation.\nAudio-only services will also continue to be covered when audio-visual services are not available or when the\nmember chooses audio-only services in lieu of audio-visual telehealth or an in-person visit. Audio-only visits\nmust contain all elements of the billable procedure codes or rate codes and all required documentation.\nProviders must document in the chart of the NYS Medicaid member why audio-only services were used for\neach audio-only encounter.\nThis guidance does not change any other NYS Medicaid program requirements, with respect to authorized\nservices or provider enrollment, and does not expand authorization to bill NYS Medicaid beyond service\nproviders who are currently enrolled to bill Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) or contracted with a Medicaid\nManaged Care (MMC) Plan.\n"}

General Information\nProviders may use this guidance to prepare for upcoming policy changes tied to the end of the COVID-19\nPHE as it applies to dates of service on or after May 11, 2023. This guidance supersedes guidance issued in\nJune 2021. This guidance outlines policies related to audio-visual telehealth, audio-only telehealth, remote\npatient monitoring (RPM), Store and Forward, virtual check-ins, virtual patient education, and virtual\nemergency care.\nNYS DOH and its partner state agencies expect full compliance with updates to telehealth modifiers and Place\nof Service (POS) rules by August 1, 2023. The NYS Office of Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG) will be\ninformed of this date to use for future audits. The Notifications of Enforcement Discretion issued by the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights (OCR) expired with the end of the COVID-\n19 PHE. OCR is providing a 90-calendar day transition period for providers to comply with Health Insurance\nPortability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) rules in their provision of telehealth. The transition period expires\non August 9, 2023. More information on HIPAA and telehealth can be found on the U.S. Department of Health\nand Human Services HIPAA and Telehealth “Expiration of COVID-19 Public Health Emergency HIPAA\nNotifications of Enforcement Discretion” web page, located at: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-\nprofessionals/special-topics/telehealth/index.html.\nThe information in this guidance applies to the following NYS Medicaid providers and applies to services\ndelivered via FFS or under contracted MMC Plans:\n• NYS Medicaid-enrolled providers and facilities, including NYS DOH-licensed providers;\n• NYS Office of Addiction Services and Supports (OASAS)-certified or designated providers and\nfacilities;\n• NYS Office of Mental Health (OMH)-licensed or designated providers and facilities; and\n• NYS Office for People With Developmental Disabilities (OPWDD) Article 16 Clinic services (e.g., OT,\nPT, Speech, Psychology, etc.). This guidance does not include Independent Practitioner Services for\nIndividuals with Developmental Disabilities (IPSIDD).\nPlease note: NYS OMH, OPWDD, and OASAS have issued, or may issue, separate guidance and/or\nregulations that may supersede or supplement the requirements for telehealth for NYS Medicaid members\nbeing served under the authority of those respective agencies and address telehealth delivery for services\ncertified by those agencies under the Mental Hygiene Law (MHL).\nAdditional programmatic guidance may be published by NYS DOH that specifically allows or prohibits the use\nof telehealth by type of service.\nII. Telehealth Definitions\nA. Definition of Telehealth\nTelehealth is defined as the use of electronic information and communication technologies to deli"}
{"doc_id": "mu_no3_feb23_speced_pr.pdf", "chunk_id": "mu_no3_feb23_speced_pr.pdf::0003", "char_start": 12454, "char_end": 17454, "pages": [3, 4, 5], "text": "ver health\ncare to patients at a distance. NYS Medicaid covered services provided via telehealth include assessment,\ndiagnosis, consultation, treatment, education, care management and/or self-management of a NYS Medicaid\nmember. This definition includes audio-only services when audio-visual is unavailable, or a member chooses\naudio-only.\nB. Originating Site\nThe originating site is where the NYS Medicaid member is located at the time health care services are\ndelivered to the individual by means of telehealth. On professional claims, POS “02”, “10”, or “11” must be\ncoded to document the location of the NYS Medicaid member during the telehealth visit.\nNew York State Medicaid Update Special Edition pg. 3\n\nC. Distant Site\nThe distant site is the site where the telehealth provider is located while delivering health care services by\nmeans of telehealth. Any secure site within the fifty United States (U.S.) or U.S. territories, is eligible to be a\ndistant site for delivery and payment purposes, including Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and\nproviders homes, for NYS Medicaid-enrolled patients. To receive reimbursement from NYS Medicaid,\nproviders submitting telehealth claims or encounters must be NYS-licensed and enrolled in NYS Medicaid.\nThe enrollment requirement is applicable only to enrollable provider types, including pharmacies and most\nlicensed practitioners.\nD. Telemedicine or Audio-Visual Telehealth\nTelemedicine, or audio-visual telehealth, uses two-way synchronous electronic audio-visual communications\nto deliver clinical health care services to a patient at an originating site by a telehealth provider located at a\ndistant site. Telemedicine includes teledentistry. Teledentistry, an alternative method of delivering care, can\nprovide a convenient and accessible platform for urgent dental problems, virtual consultations, monitoring of\npatients, and assistance in making referrals. By improving access to care using teledentistry, long\ntransportation barriers in rural areas to see dental providers and visits to urgent care facilities and emergency\nrooms for dental-related problems may be avoided. Teledentistry also makes in-office appointments more\navailable for patients who need them.\nE. Store-and-Forward Technology\nStore-and-forward technology involves the asynchronous, electronic transmission of health information of a\nNYS Medicaid member, in the form of patient-specific pre-recorded videos and/or digital images from a\nprovider at an originating site to a telehealth provider at a distant site. Store-and-forward technology aids in\ndiagnoses when live video contact is not readily available or not necessary. Additionally, pre-recorded videos\nand/or static digital images (e.g., pictures) must be specific to the condition of the NYS Medicaid member, as\nwell as be adequate for rendering or confirming a diagnosis or a plan of treatment.\nF. Remote Patient Monitoring\nRemote patient monitoring (RPM) uses digital technologies to collect medical data and other personal health\ninformation from the NYS Medicaid member in one location and can electronically transmit that information\nto health care providers in a different location for assessment and recommendations. Monitoring programs\ncan collect a wide range of health data from the point of care, such as vital signs, blood pressure, heart rate,\nweight, blood sugar, blood oxygen levels and electrocardiogram readings. RPM may include follow-up on\npreviously transmitted data conducted through communication technologies or by telephone.\nMedical conditions that may be treated/monitored by means of RPM include, but are not limited to, congestive\nheart failure, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), wound care, polypharmacy, mental\nor behavioral problems, and technology-dependent care such as continuous oxygen, ventilator care, total\nparenteral nutrition, or enteral feeding. RPM may be used during pregnancy and postpartum, as outlined in\nthe New York State Medicaid Expansion of Remote Patient Monitoring for Maternal Care article published in\nthe September 2022 issue of the Medicaid Update, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health\n_care/medicaid/program/update/2022/docs/mu_no10_sep22_pr.pdf.\nG. Telephonic (Audio-only)\nTelephonic service uses two-way electronic audio-only communications to deliver services to a patient at an\noriginating site by a telehealth provider. For complete billing instructions for telephonic services, providers\ncan refer to “VII. Billing Rules for Telehealth Services”, “F. Telephonic (Audio-only) Reimbursement Overview”\non page 11 of this issue.\nNew York State Medicaid Update Special Edition pg. 4\n\nNYS Medicaid is expanding coverage of remote services to include audio-only visits, to increase access to\nservices, eliminate barriers, supplement oversight of chronic conditions, and improve outcomes. Decisions\non what type of visit the NYS Medicaid member receives should be based on their best interest, not that of\nthe provider n"}

Providers must use professional judgment to determine\nwhether audio-only services meet patient needs and whether a visit is eligible for audio-only based on criteria\nbelow. NYS DOH anticipates only rare occasions when audio-only visits are appropriate for non-behavioral\nhealth (BH) services. For example, during weather emergencies when the patient is unable to use audio-\nvisual technologies or when the visit could otherwise not occur unless provided via audio-only telehealth. NYS\nDOH will monitor audio-only billing and take steps to limit overuse and prevent misuse of audio-only services.\nThis new policy will be monitored following the COVID-19 PHE to determine if additional guidance is\nnecessary.\nNYS Medicaid covers audio-only visits for NYS Medicaid members when all the following conditions are met:\n• audio-visual telehealth is not available to the patient due to lack of patient equipment or connectivity\n(see “VIII. Options to Support Members with Limited or Lack of Access to Devices and Services” on\npage 18 of this issue and “IX. Useful Links” on page 20 of this issue, for connectivity resources) or\naudio-only is the preference of the patient;\n• the provider must make either audio-visual or in-person appointments available at the request of the\npatient;\n• the service can be effectively delivered without a visual or in-person component, unless otherwise\nstated in guidance issued by the NYS DOH (this is a clinical decision made by the provider); and\n• the service provided via audio-only visits contains all elements of the billable procedures or rate codes\nand meets all documentation requirements as if provided in person or via an audio-visual visit.\nAdditional programmatic guidance may be published that specifically allows or prohibits the use of audio-only\ntelehealth by type of service. For example, when specific Community Based Long Term Care Services and\nSupports will have allowable telephonic billing available, it will be defined in program-specific guidance.\nAdditional agency-issued guidance outlines the appropriateness of audio-only visits for their specific\npopulations.\nH. Expanded 'After Hours' Access\nAn add-on payment is available for visits that occur on evenings, weekends, and holidays. An evening visit is\none which is scheduled for and occurs after 6 p.m. A weekend visit is one that is scheduled for and occurs on\nSaturday or Sunday. A holiday visit is one that is scheduled for and occurs on a designated holiday. When\nthe after hours visit is completed via telehealth, the appropriate telehealth modifier must be used (see “VII.\nBilling Rules for Telehealth Services” on page 8 of this issue for specific guidance).\nI. Virtual Check-In\nVirtual check-ins are brief medical interactions between a physician or other qualified health care professional\nand a patient. Virtual check-ins may be especially helpful for patients with ongoing chronic conditions that\nwould benefit from recurring check-ins with their provider. A virtual check-in can be conducted via several\ntechnology-based modalities, including communication by telephone or by secure text-based messaging,\nsuch as electronic interactions via patient portal, secure email, or secure text messaging. Communication\nmust be HIPAA-compliant and don’t relate to an Evaluation and Management (E&M) visit the patient had\nwithin the past seven days, nor lead to a related E&M visit within 24 hours (see “VII. Billing Rules for Telehealth\nServices” on page 8 of this issue for specific information on code and modifiers).\nNew York State Medicaid Update Special Edition pg. 5\n\nJ. eVisits\neVisits are patient-initiated communications with a medical provider through a text-based and HIPAA-\ncompliant digital platform, such as a patient portal. eVisits are a type of Virtual Check-In which occur\nthrough asynchronous communication; the exchange is neither real-time nor face-to-face. They are\nintended to remotely assess non-urgent conditions and prevent unnecessary in-person visits. Coverage of\neVisits reimburses providers for the problem-focused communication and medical decision-making conducted\noutside of their normal visits. NYS Medicaid intends to cover eVisits on or after October 1, 2023 and will\nrelease guidance outlining coverage policies once approved. eVisits are not currently a covered service in\nNYS Medicaid FFS.\nK. Virtual Patient Education\nVirtual patient education means education and training for patient self-management by a qualified health care\nprofessional via telehealth. Virtual patient education delivers health education to patients, their families, or\ncaregivers, and is reimbursable only for services that are otherwise reimbursable when delivered in-person\nand when the provider meets certain billing requirements.\nThe National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) is reimbursable when provided as a live/synchronous\nprogram (using code “0403T”) and is now also reimbursable when provided as an on-demand/asynchronous\nprog"}

NDPPs must meet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nrequirements and adhere to previously published guidance.\nL. Virtual eTriage\nIn accordance with The CMS Emergency Triage, Treat, and Transport Model with the Department of Health\nParallel Model article published in the November 2021 issue of the Medicaid Update, located at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2021/docs/mu_no13_nov21_pr.pdf,\nauthorized ambulance services responding to 911 calls may facilitate telehealth encounters where\nappropriate when providing “treatment in place”. The visit should be reported by both the ambulance service\n[as an Emergency Triage, Treat, and Transport (ET3) claim] and the telehealth provider (as a telehealth\nclaim). This model mirrors the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ET3 Model and will only\nbe allowable while the CMS program is active, and only to ambulance services participating in the national\nmodel. The CMS ET3 program is scheduled to end December 31, 2023. A future Medicaid Update issue\nregarding treatment in place and alternative destinations will provide additional guidance for ambulance\nproviders.\nM. eConsults (Interprofessional Consultations)\neConsults, or interprofessional consultations between a treating/requesting provider and a consulting\nprovider, are intended to improve access to specialty expertise by assisting the treating practitioner with the\ncare of the patient without patient contact with the consulting practitioner. CMS announced in a “Coverage\nand Payment of Interprofessional Consultation in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program\n(CHIP)” letter on January 5, 2023, located at: https://www.medicaid.gov/federal-policy-guidance/down\nloads/sho23001.pdf, that coverage of interprofessional consultations is now permissible and that State\nMedicaid programs may seek CMS approval to reimburse consulting providers for eConsults. NYS Medicaid\nintends to request approval of eConsult coverage from CMS and will release guidance outlining coverage\npolicies once approved. eConsults are not currently a covered service in NYS Medicaid FFS.\nNew York State Medicaid Update Special Edition pg. 6\n\nIII. Telehealth Providers\n\"Telehealth provider\" is defined in Public Health Law (PHL) §2999-cc, located at:\nhttps://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PBH/2999-CC, and, per NYS regulation, Title 18 of the New York\nCodes, Rules and Regulations (NYCRR) Part 538, located at: https://regs.health.ny.gov/volume-c-title-\n18/content/part-538-state-reimbursement-telehealth-services, shall also include:\n1. Voluntary foster care agencies certified by the NYS Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS)\nand licensed pursuant to Article 29-I of PHL, as well as providers employed by those agencies.\n2. Providers licensed or certified by the New York State Education Department (NYSED) to provide\nApplied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) therapy.\n3. Radiologists licensed pursuant to Article 131 of the Education Law and credentialed by the site from\nwhich the radiologist practices.\n4. All NYS Medicaid providers and providers employed by NYS Medicaid facilities, or provider agencies\nwho are authorized to provide in-person services, are authorized to provide such services via\ntelehealth if such telehealth services are appropriate to meet the needs of the patient and are within\nthe scope of practice of the provider.\nIV. Confidentiality\nServices provided by means of telehealth must be in compliance with HIPAA and all other relevant laws and\nregulations governing confidentiality, privacy, and consent, including, but not limited to 45 Code of Federal\nRegulations (CFR) Parts 160 and 164 [HIPAA Security Rules]; located at: https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-\nprofessionals/privacy/laws-regulations/combined-regulation-text/index.html; 42 CFR, Part 2; located at:\nhttps://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/regulatory-initiatives/hipaa-part-2/index.html; PHL Article 27-F;\nlocated at: https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PBH/A27-F; and MHL §33.13, located at:\nhttps://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/MHY/33.13. All providers must take steps to reasonably ensure\nprivacy during all patient-practitioner interactions.\nThe Notifications of Enforcement Discretion issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’\nOffice for Civil Rights (OCR) expired with the end of the COVID-19 PHE. OCR is providing a 90-calendar day\ntransition period for providers to comply with HIPAA rules in their provision of telehealth. The transition period\nexpires on August 9, 2023. More information on HIPAA and telehealth can be found on the U.S. Department\nof Health and Human Services website, located at: https://www.hhs.gov/.\nV.

This includes activities associated with the collection and verification of\ninformation specific to credentials and prior affiliations/employment. A hospital originating site may therefore\nenter into a contract with the distant site to receive and collect credentialing information, perform all required\nverification activities, and act on behalf of the originating site hospital for such credentialing purposes\nregarding those physicians who will be providing patient consultations via telehealth.\nNew York State Medicaid Update Special Edition pg. 7\n\nSuch contracts must establish that the originating site hospital retains ultimate responsibility for the physician\ncredentialing. Distant site hospitals may not delegate, through a contract, their responsibility for peer review,\nquality assurance/quality improvement activities and decision-making authority for granting medical staff\nmembership or professional privileges (physician privileging).\nCertified Asthma Educators (Verification Requirements)\nThe hospital, Diagnostic and Treatment Centers (D&TCs) or office serving as the originating site is\nresponsible for ensuring that the Certified Asthma Educator (CAE) providing self-management training\nservices via telehealth, is a NYS licensed, registered, or certified health care professional, who is also certified\nas an educator by the National Asthma Educator Certification Board (NAECB). NAECB educators are\nexpected to practice within the scope of practice that is appropriate to their respective discipline, as defined\nby the NYSED Office of the Professions.\nCertified Diabetes Educators\nCertification through the Certification Board for Diabetes Educators (CBDCE) is no longer required.\nRegistered dieticians can enroll as NYS Medicaid providers and deliver diabetes self-management training\nvia telehealth.\nVI. Patient Rights and Consents\nThe practitioner shall confirm the identity of the NYS Medicaid member and provide the NYS Medicaid\nmember with basic information about the services that they will be receiving via telehealth. Written consent\nby the NYS Medicaid member is not required, but the provider must document informed consent in the chart\nof the patient before or during the first visit in which telehealth services are provided. Telehealth\nsessions/services shall not be recorded without the consent of the NYS Medicaid member.\nInformed consent means that telehealth practitioners provide members with sufficient information and\neducation about telehealth to assist them in making an informed choice to receive telehealth services. This\nmust include the following:\n1. The telehealth provider must confirm that the NYS Medicaid member is aware of the potential\nadvantages and disadvantages of telehealth, be given the option of not participating in telehealth\nservices and information regarding their right to request a change in service delivery mode at any time.\n2. The telehealth provider must inform NYS Medicaid members that they will not be denied services if\nthey do not consent to telehealth devices or request to receive services in-person.\n3. Where the NYS Medicaid member is a minor, consent shall also be provided by the parent/guardian\nor other person who has legal authority to consent to health care on behalf of the minor.\nInformed consent shall be obtained through a process of communication between the telehealth provider and\nNYS Medicaid member. Although some providers may choose to document informed consent to receive\ntelehealth services using a form, it is not necessary to use a specific form. Informed consent processes should\nbe specified in the policies and procedures of the provider.\nVII. Billing Rules for Telehealth Services\nA. Payment Parity with In-Person Services\nUnder NYS Law Chapter 45 Article 29-G §2999-DD, located at: https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/\nlaws/PBH/2999-DD, healthcare services delivered by means of telehealth are entitled to reimbursement on\nthe same basis, at the same rate, and to the same extent the equivalent services, as may be defined in\nregulations promulgated by the commissioner, are reimbursed when delivered in person. Exceptions are in\nplace for certain costs, including facility fees in instances when such costs were not incurred in the provision\nof telehealth services because neither the originating nor the distant site occurring within the fa"}

Providers who would report POS\n11 if the visit had been in person should report POS 11 on the telehealth claim to ensure\nproper reimbursement.\nD. Billing for Teledentistry Services\nNYS Medicaid reimburses for teledentistry and telephonic services. For additional information, dental\nproviders can refer to the February 2019 Expansion of Telehealth Special Edition issue of the Medicaid\nUpdate, located at: https://health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2019/feb19_mu_speced.pdf.\nNew York State Medicaid Update Special Edition pg. 9\n\nThe types of teledental (audio-visual) encounters are synchronous (real time) encounters and asynchronous\n(Store and Forward) encounters. Synchronous (“D9995”) encounters are live, two-way encounters between\na patient or caregiver and provider. These types of encounters may include urgent visits, follow-up visits or\nnew patient screenings with the use of audio-visual technology. Additionally, synchronous teledental\nencounters may also occur between a patient or caregiver along with their dental provider and a specialist,\nsuch as an endodontist or oral surgeon. For example, a patient presents for an in-person visit to their dental\nprovider for tooth pain. The dental provider determines through radiographs and examination that the tooth in\nquestion requires an extraction by an oral surgeon. While the patient is still present, the dental provider then\ninitiates a teledental encounter with an oral surgeon. The oral surgeon conducts a consultation with the dental\nprovider along with the patient. This results in the patient scheduling an appointment for an extraction with\nthe oral surgeon, thereby eliminating the need to schedule an in-person consultation on a different day.\nBy contrast, asynchronous (“D9996”) encounters involve the transmission of recorded health information\nsuch as charting, radiographs, digital impressions and video to a dental provider who assesses the information\nfor treatment needs at a later time. For example, a hygienist who is employed by an Article 28 facility and has\na collaboration arrangement with a dentist also employed by the same facility, can be in a remote location\nsuch as a School-Based Health Center (SBHC). From there the hygienist can perform dental hygiene services\nfor the patient, including gathering information that will be sent to the dentist for further review. The dentist\ncan then review the information at a later time, such as during last-minute cancellations or no-show\nappointments in their schedule.\nWhen billing for teledentistry services, modifiers cannot be used by dentists.

Telephonic (audio only) services use two-way electronic audio only\ncommunications to deliver services to a patient at on originating site by a telehealth provider located at a\ndistant site. This service is billed utilizing Current Dental Terminology (CDT) code “D9991”.\nDental telehealth services shall adhere to the standards of appropriate patient care required in other dental\nhealth care settings, including but not limited to appropriate patient examination and review of the medical\nand dental history of the patient. For additional information, providers can refer to NYS Law Chapter 45 Article\n29-G §2999-DD, located at: https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PBH/2999-DD.\nE. General Billing Guidelines for Dual Eligible Enrollees\nPursuant to federal law, Medicaid is the payer of last resort, which means Medicaid will make payments only\nafter all other sources of reimbursement have been exhausted. Therefore, potential third-party reimbursement\nsources including Medicare, must be billed prior to billing Medicaid. For additional information, providers can\nrefer to the following NYS Medicaid billing guidance for dual enrollees:\n• NYS DOH, OMH, OASAS “Duals Reimbursement in MMC” memorandum, located at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/managed_care/plans/docs/2021-12-01_duals_reimbursement\n_mmc.pdf.\n• NYS DOH, OMH, OASAS Medicaid Managed Care Billing Guidance for Dual Eligible Enrollees policy\nguidance, located at: https://omh.ny.gov/omhweb/bho/policy-guidance/billing_for_dual_eligible_enroll\nees.pdf.\nFor dually enrolled Medicare and NYS Medicaid members, if Medicare covers the telehealth encounter, NYS\nMedicaid will reimburse the Part B coinsurance and deductible to the extent permitted by NYS law. For\nbenefits covered by Medicare, any telehealth restrictions set by Medicare apply to dually-enrolled members\nunless otherwise stated in policy, located on the CMS “List of Telehealth Services” web page at:\nhttps://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-General-Information/Telehealth/Telehealth-Codes.\nNew York State Medicaid Update Special Edition pg. 10\n\nThe Performance Enhancement Reform Act, or omnibus budget for federal fiscal year (FY) 2023, included\nseveral provisions that extend telehealth flexibilities for federal programs through December 31, 2024. Several\nflexibilities apply to Medicare’s coverage of telehealth, including suspending geography-based telehealth\nrequirements, allowing audio-only telehealth, patient homes as originating sites, FQHCs and RHCs to\ncontinue to offer telehealth, and delaying in-person visit requirements prior to delivering mental health services\nvia telehealth. When such flexibilities end, NYS Medicaid coverage of some services via telehealth for those\ndually enrolled may be impacted. For additional information, providers can refer to the Congress “House\nCommittee Print 117-59 - RULES COMMITTEE PRINT 117-59 TEXT OF H.R. 4040, THE ADVANCING\nTELEHEALTH BEYOND COVID-19 ACT OF 2021 [Showing the text of H.R. 4040, as introduced, with\nmodifications.]” web page, located at: https://www.congress.gov/committee-print/117th-congress/house-\ncommittee-print/48141.\nF. Telephonic (Audio-only) Reimbursement Overview\n1. Following the COVID-19 PHE, when audio-only telehealth is used in accordance with the policy\noutlined in “II. Telehealth Definitions”, “G. Telephonic (Audio-only)” on page 4 of this issue,\nproviders may bill NYS Medicaid as they would for an in-person or audio-visual telehealth visit (using\nthe appropriate procedure or rate code).\na. Services provided via audio-only visits shall contain all elements of the billable procedures or\nrate codes and must meet all documentation requirements as if provided in person or via an\naudio-visual visit.\nb. Audio-only rate codes used during the COVID-19 PHE will be retired. FQHCs can bill the\nProspective Payment System (PPS) rate code “4012” or “4013”, depending on on-site\npresence as outlined in “VII. Billing Rules for Telehealth Services”, “M. FFS Billing for\nTelehealth by Site and Location” on page 14 of this issue. Wrap payments are available for\nany telehealth services, including telephonic services reimbursed by an MMC Plan, under\nqualifying PPS and off-site rate codes.\nc. Audio-only E&M procedure codes “99441” through “99443” will continue to be billable, though\nas of the date of this guidance, 151-days post COVID-19 PHE, Medicare will no longer cover\ncodes "}

All audio-only claims and encounter must include the 93 or FQ modifier unless modifiers are not\nallowable (e.g., teledentistry). The UA modifier should no longer be used to indicate the service as\ndelivered via audio-only.\n3. When a POS is allowable on a claim or encounter, providers should report POS “02” for telehealth\nprovided other than in patient’s home, “10” for telehealth provided in the home of the patient, except\nin cases where POS “11” is typically submitted (private practice or office setting); POS “11”\nproviders should continue to report POS “11” and use telehealth modifiers on the claim or\nencounter to identify it as telehealth.\nMMC Plans may have separate detailed billing guidance that supplements the billing guidance outlined in this\nissue, but cover all services appropriate to deliver through telehealth, including audio-only telehealth.\nFurther detail on FFS code coverage is provided in specialized guidance for mental health, substance use\nand NYS OPWDD services (see “IX. Useful Links” on page 20 of this issue).\nG. Store-and-Forward Technology:\n1. Reimbursement will be made to the consulting distant-site practitioner when billed with an appropriate\nprocedure code.\n2. The consulting distant-site practitioner must provide the requesting originating-site practitioner with a\nwritten report of the consultation in order for payment to be made.\n3. The consulting practitioner should bill the CPT code for the professional service appended with the\ntelehealth GQ modifier.\nNew York State Medicaid Update Special Edition pg. 11\n\nH. RPM:\n1. Telehealth services provided by means of RPM should be billed using CPT code \"99091\" [collection\nand interpretation of physiologic data (e.g., Electrocardiography (ECG), blood pressure, glucose\nmonitoring) digitally stored and/or transmitted by the patient and/or caregiver to the physician or\nother qualified health care professional, qualified by education, training and licensure/regulation\n(when applicable) requiring a minimum of 30 minutes of time].\n2. A fee of $48.00 per month will be paid for RPM.\n3. Providers are not to bill \"99091\" more than one time per member per month.\n4. Maternity RPM services:\na. In an effort to reduce maternal and infant morbidity and mortality, an additional allowance may\nbe reimbursable for RPM equipment provided by enrolled providers to pregnant and postpartum\nNYS Medicaid members using CPT codes “99453” and “99454” with HD modifier. Additional\ninformation can be found in the New York State Medicaid Expansion of Remote Patient\nMonitoring for Maternal Care article published in the September 2022 issue of the Medicaid\nUpdate, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2022/\ndocs/mu_no10_sep22_pr.pdf.\nb. Please note: “99091” and “99454” are both intended to be billed once monthly but cannot be\nbilled on the same day. This replaces the guidance for billing these codes that was included in\nthe September 2022 issue of the Medicaid Update that stated, “CPT Code \"99454\" is billed\nalong with CPT Code \"99091\".\n5. FQHCs that have opted out of Ambulatory Patient Groups (APGs) are unable to bill for RPM\nservices at this time.\nI. After Hours\nAn add-on payment is available for visits that occur on evenings, weekends, and holidays. An evening visit is\none that is scheduled for and occurs after 6 p.m. A weekend visit is one that is scheduled for and occurs on\nSaturday or Sunday. A holiday visit is one that is scheduled for and occurs on a designated holiday. When\nthe after hours visit is completed via telehealth, the appropriate modifier from the table below must be used.\nProviders should use the following CPT codes as appropriate:\nProcedure Procedure Description Appropriate NYS\nCodes Telehealth Modifiers Medicaid\nRate\n99050 Services provided in the office at times other than 95, GT, 93, or FQ $7.07\nregularly scheduled office hours, or days when the\noffice is normally closed (e.g., holidays, Saturday or\nSunday), in addition to basic service.\n99051 Services provided in the office during regularly 95, GT, 93, or FQ $7.07\nscheduled evening, weekend, or holiday office hours, in\naddition to basic service.\nPlease note: “99050” and “99051” can be used in conjunction with E&M codes only.\nThese CPT codes are not payable if they are the only CPT procedure(s) listed on the claim. They are\nreimbursed only when accompanied by a valid CPT code that represents an in-office or remote medical\nservice/procedure. The entire visit must occur outside of normal hours. Services occurring after hours due to\noffice/provider delays are not eligible for this supplemental payment.
