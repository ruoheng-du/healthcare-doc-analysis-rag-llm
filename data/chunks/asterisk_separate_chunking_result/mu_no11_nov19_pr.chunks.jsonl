Please note: Additional information on adding/editing users can be found under the “User Admin”\nlink on the left-hand side of the account holders dashboard screen. The login page for ePACES can be found at:\nhttps://www.emedny.org/epaces/.\nIt is imperative that individuals with ePACES access not share their user ID information with others. New York\nState (NYS) Medicaid and the Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA) require that each\nindividual has a unique user ID. When additional members of a provider’s office require access to ePACES, they\nmust be assigned the appropriate individual level of access by the ePACES Administrator.\nNYS Medicaid encourages providers to have more than one Administrator. The original ePACES\nAdministrator has the authority to assign additional Administrators. This practice allows efficiency should an\nAdministrator be out of the office or become disaffiliated with the organization. Please note: As soon as\nAdministrators or users become disaffiliated with a provider organization, their ePACES account password must\nbe changed. Once the password is changed, the Administrator must then inactivate that User account following\nthe 120-day ePACES data retention requirement.\nePACES account holders who are currently sharing account information and/or do not know the identity of their\nePACES account Administrator should call the eMedNY Call Center for assistance at (800) 343-9000.\n"}
