Individuals can provide their Local Department of Social Services (LDSS) with either a Practitioner\nStatement of Need for Personal Care/Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Services For Adults\n18 and Over (for Immediate Needs) form (DOH-5779), located at: https://www.health.ny.\ngov/forms/doh-5779.pdf, or\n2.

Once the individual\nprovides their LDSS with a completed Immediate Needs packet, the LDSS will refer their case to NYIA to\nschedule a community health assessment (CHA) and clinical appointment, to be completed in an expedited\ntimeframe.\nPlease note: This update does not apply to children under 18 years of age. LDSS will continue to perform\nthe assessments for this population and require a physician’s order form (DOH-4359 or HCSP-M11Q).\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• For more information on the Immediate Needs process under NYIA, please refer to Administrative\nDirective memorandum, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/publications/\n22adm01.htm.\n• All questions regarding NYIA and this update should be directed to\nindependent.assessor@health.ny.gov.\n"}

Protective factors\nthat may boost child or parental resilience may include, but are not limited to:\n• supportive and caring relationships and social connections;\n• programs that understand a person’s background and culture;\n• a healthy lifestyle, which may include regular exercise, mindfulness, getting sufficient sleep, and eating\na healthy and nutritious diet;\n• economic support/stability for families; and\n• quality childcare and education early in life.\nNew York State (NYS) Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) has developed materials for providers\nto share this information with adult patients, parents, and caregivers, such as a brochure titled Understanding\nadverse childhood experiences (ACEs), which is available in multiple languages on the NYS OCFS\n“Publications” web page: https://ocfs.ny.gov/publications/index.php?find=Pub.+5222.\nAdditional Information\nVisit the NYS OCFS “Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)” web page, located at:\nhttps://ocfs.ny.gov/programs/cwcs/aces.php, for additional information and resources.\n"}
