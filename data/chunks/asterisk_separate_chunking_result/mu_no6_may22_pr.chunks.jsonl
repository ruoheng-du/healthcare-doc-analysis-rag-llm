The last time NYS participated was in federal\nfiscal year 2021. CMS, along with their contractor, NCI. Inc., and the NYS Office of the Medicaid Inspector\nGeneral (OMIG), have the authority to collect information under sections 1902(a)(27) and 2107(b)(1) of the\nSocial Security Act. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) statutes and\nregulations require the provision of such information upon request, and the information can be provided\nwithout patient consent.\nNCI Inc., in partnership with OMIG, will be requesting documentation for randomly selected claims to perform\na medical review. If a provider’s submitted claim is selected for review, NCI Inc. and OMIG will request written\ndocumentation to substantiate claims paid. Providers are asked to submit copies of the specific medical\ndocuments for the patient, as requested in the letter the provider will receive from the CMS contractor, directly\nto the CMS contractor and send a second copy to OMIG. Providers are urged to submit records to OMIG via\nemail at PERMNY@omig.ny.gov or fax at (518) 402-1845, as it allows PERM staff to obtain records as soon\nas they are sent and enables them to effectively and efficiently identify any issues that may arise, as needed.\nProviders are asked to ensure that the records are sent in a secure way. Records may also be mailed to the\nfollowing address:\nOffice of the Medicaid Inspector General\n800 North Pearl Street First Floor\nAlbany, NY 12204\nAttention: PERM\nRequests for documentation are anticipated to begin in November 2022. The sampled claims will have\nbeen paid between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023. Compliance with medical record requests and providing\nfull medical records for the randomly selected claims is required. Failure to provide requested records will\nresult in a determination by CMS of erroneous payment, and OMIG will pursue recoveries, as appropriate.\nOnce the review is completed OMIG will pursue recovery of any payments determined to be made in error. It\nis in the best interest of providers to comply with requests for documentation and provide full and complete\nresponsive records. In the last PERM cycle audit, the NYS error rate for medical reviews was measured at\n1.63 percent, compared to a national error rate average of 13.9 percent. Three quarters of the claims identified\nby CMS as paid erroneously were later unsubstantiated by OMIG utilizing records submitted by providers in\nresponse to documentation requests.\nQuestions\nQuestions should be directed to the PERM Project Staff by telephone at (518) 474-3499 or by email at\nPERMNY@omig.ny.gov.\n"}

This expansion, approved on March 24, 2022 by the Centers\nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in State Plan Amendment (SPA) #21-0026, includes sickle cell\ndisease (SCD) as a single qualifying condition for Health Homes Serving Adults (HHSA) and Health Homes\nServing Children (HHSC). Please note: Medicaid State Plan Amendment (#21–0026) can be accessed via\nthe NYS DOH “Medicaid Health Homes - State Plan Amendments” web page, located at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/medicaid_health_homes/med_spa.htm.\nIndividuals enrolled in the NYS Medicaid Health Home program must also meet appropriateness criteria,\nwhich includes significant behavioral, medical, or social risk factors requiring intensive care management\nservices, and have:\n• two or more chronic conditions, or\n• one single qualifying condition, such as:\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), or\nserious mental illness (SMI) (adults), or\nserious emotional disturbances (SED), or\ncomplex trauma (children), or\nnew: SCD.\nThe inclusion of SCD as a single qualifying condition recognizes the unique challenges in access to services\nfaced by individuals with SCD, their families and/or supports. One key focus is to ensure effective transition\nof young adults with SCD from pediatric to adult care. These individuals often face difficulty accessing\nservices, including finding adult specialists who accept patients with SCD, who understand SCD, and who\nacknowledge the patient’s readiness for self-management. Additional challenges include:\n• managing the comorbidities associated with SCD,\n• understanding pain and pain control/management issues,\n• recognizing self-care and self-efficacy,\n• acknowledging and addressing social determinants of health,\n• connecting to community support services (such as peer supports) and appropriate educational\ninformation.\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• Questions should be directed to the Health Home program at healthhomes@health.ny.gov.\n• For information regarding the implementation of the NYS Medicaid Health Home program, providers\ncan refer to the April 2012 Special Edition Medicaid Update titled Introducing Health Homes Improving\nCare for Medicaid Recipients with Chronic Conditions, available at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2012/april12muspec.pdf.\n"}
