The institutionalized spouse is considered medically needy if their resources\nare at or below a certain level and the monthly income after certain deductions is less than the cost of care in the facility. Federal and State laws\nrequire that spousal impoverishment rules be used to determine an institutionalized spouse’s eligibility for Medicaid. These rules protect some of the\nincome and resources of the couple for the community spouse. Please note: Spousal impoverishment rules do not apply to an institutionalized spouse\nwho is eligible under the Modified Adjusted Gross Income rules.\nIf you or your spouse are:\n1. In a medical institution or nursing facility and are likely to remain there for at least 30 consecutive days; or\n2. Receiving home and community-based services provided pursuant to a waiver under §1915(c) of the federal Social Security Act and are likely to receive\nsuch services for at least 30 consecutive days; or\n3. Receiving institutional or non-institutional services and are enrolled in a Managed Long Term Care Plan; and\n4. Married to a spouse who does not meet any of the criteria set forth under items 1 through 3 listed above, these income and resource eligibility rules for an\ninstitutionalized spouse may apply to you or your spouse.\nIf you wish to discuss these eligibility provisions, please contact your local department of social services to request an assessment of the total\nvalue of your or your spouses combined countable resources, even if you have no intention of pursuing a Medicaid application. It is to the advantage of the\ncommunity spouse to request such an assessment to make certain that allowable resources are not depleted by you for your spouse’s cost of care. To request\nsuch an assessment, please contact your local department of social services or complete and mail the Request for Assessment – Spousal\nImpoverishment form (DOH-5298). New York City residents may contact the Human Resources Administration Medicaid Helpline at (888) 692-6116.\nResource Information\nEffective January 1, 1996, the community spouse is allowed to keep resources in an amount equal to the greater of\nthe following amounts:\n1. $74,820.00 (the NYS minimum spousal resource standard); or\n2. $157,920.00 (the amount of the spousal share up to the maximum amount permitted under federal law for 2025).\nFor purposes of this calculation, “spousal share” is the amount equal to one-half of the total value of the countable resources of you and your spouse\nat the beginning of the most recent continuous period of institutionalization of the institutionalized spouse. The most recent continuous period of\ninstitutionalization is defined as the most recent period you and your spouse met the criteria listed in items 1 through 4 (listed under the\n“If you or your spouse are” section above). In determining the total value of the countable resources, we will not count the value of your home, house\nhold items, personal property, car, or certain funds established for burial expenses.\nThe community spouse may be able to obtain additional amounts of resources to generate income when the otherwise available income of the community\nspouse, together with the income allowance from the institutionalized spouse, is less than the maximum community spouse monthly income allowance,\nby requesting a fair hearing or commencing a family court proceeding against the institutionalized spouse. You can contact your local department of\nsocial services or an attorney about requesting a Medicaid fair hearing. Your attorney can provide more information about commencing a family\ncourt proceeding. You may be able to get a lawyer at no cost by calling you"}

Upon receipt of such request and all relevant documentation, the\nlocal district will assess and document the total value of the couple’s countable resources and provide each spouse with a copy of the\nassessment and the documentation upon which it is based. If the request is not filed with a New York State Medicaid application, the\nlocal department of social services may charge up to $25.00 for the cost of preparing and copying the assessment and documentation.\nIncome Information\nA spouse may request an assessment/determination of:\n1. The community spouse monthly income allowance (an amount of up to $3,948.00 a month for 2025); and\n2. A maximum family member allowance for each minor child, dependent child, dependent parent, or dependent\nsibling of either spouse living with the community spouse of $882.00 for 2025 (if the family member has no\nincome of their own).\nThe community spouse may be able to obtain additional amounts of the institutionalized spouse’s income, due to exceptional circumstances resulting\nin significant financial distress, then would otherwise be allowed under the Medicaid program, by requesting a fair hearing or commencing a family\ncourt proceeding against the institutionalized spouse. Significant financial distress means exceptional expenses which the community spouse cannot\nbe expected to meet from the monthly maintenance needs allowance or from amounts held in resources. These expenses may include but are not\nlimited to recurring or extraordinary non-covered medical expenses (of the community spouse or dependent family members who live with the\ncommunity spouse); amounts to preserve, maintain, or make major repairs to the home; and amounts necessary to preserve an income-producing\nasset. Social Services Law §366-c(2)(g) and §366-c(4)(b) require that the amount of such support orders be deducted from the institutionalized\nspouse’s income for eligibility purposes.

New York City residents should call the Human Resources Administration Medicaid Helpline at (888) 692-6116.\nSpousal Refusal and Undue Hardship Concerning a Community Spouse’s Refusal to Provide Necessary Information\nFor purposes of determining Medicaid eligibility for the institutionalized spouse, a community spouse must cooperate by providing necessary\ninformation about their resources. Refusal to provide the necessary information shall be reason for denying Medicaid for the institutionalized\nspouse as Medicaid eligibility cannot be determined. If the applicant or recipient demonstrates that denial of Medicaid would result in undue hardship\nfor the institutionalized spouse and an assignment of support is executed or the institutionalized spouse is unable to execute such\nassignment due to physical or mental impairment, Medicaid shall be authorized. However, if the community spouse refuses to make\nsuch resource information available, the New York State Department of Health or local department of social services, at its option, may\nrefer the matter to court for recovery from the community spouse of any Medicaid expenditures for the institutionalized spouse’s care.\nUndue hardship occurs when:\n1. A community spouse fails or refuses to cooperate in providing necessary information about their resources;\n2. The institutionalized spouse is otherwise eligible for Medicaid;\n3. The institutionalized spouse is unable to obtain appropriate medical care without the provision of Medicaid; and\na. The community spouse’s whereabouts are unknown; or\nb. The community spouse is incapable of providing the required information due to illness or mental incapacity; or\nc. The community spouse lived apart from the institutionalized spouse immediately prior to institutionalization; or\nd. Due to the action or inaction of the community spouse, other than the failure or refusal to cooperate in providing necessary information about their\nresources, the institutionalized spouse will need protection from actual or threatened harm, neglect, or hazardous conditions if discharged from an\nappropriate medical setting.\nAn institutionalized spouse will not be determined ineligible for Medicaid because the community spouse refuses to make"}

Medicaid will request a contribution from a community spouse of 25\npercent of the amount their otherwise available income that exceeds the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance plus any family member\nallowance(s).

Restricted low-volume facilities will not be reimbursed for\nbreast cancersurgeries provided to NYS Medicaid members.\nEach year, NYS DOH reviews the list of low-volume facilities and releases an updated list, effective April 1. NYS DOH has completed its annual\nreview of all-payer breast cancer surgical volumes for 2021 through 2023 using the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System\ndatabase. Two hundred fifteen restricted low-volume hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers throughout NYS were identified. These\nfacilities have been notified of the restriction, effective April 1, 2025. The policy does not restrict the ability of the facility to provide diagnostic\nor excisional biopsies and post-surgical care (chemotherapy, radiation, reconstruction, etc.) for NYS Medicaid members. For mastectomy\nand lumpectomy procedures related to breast cancer, NYS Medicaid members should be directed to high-volume providers in their area.\nTo view the list of facilities where NYS Medicaid will not pay for breast cancer surgery, providers should refer to the NYS DOH “Hospitals & Ambulatory\nSurgery Centers Where Medicaid Will Not Pay for Breast Cancer Surgery” web page.

OTP\nservices are delivered by programs certified as Article 32 outpatient programs by the Office of Addiction Services and Supports and are formerly known as\nMethadone Maintenance Treatment programs.\nThe goal of the RRP is to coordinate medical services and improve quality of care for NYS Medicaid members. Coordination of care reduces the\npotential over-utilization of health care services and prevents abusive or fraudulent behavior. The RRP may restrict the NYS Medicaid member\nto care provided by, or referred by, a primary care provider, inpatient hospital, and/or primary pharmacy. A restriction is implemented if it is found\nthat the NYS Medicaid member has received a pattern of duplicative, excessive, contraindicated, or conflicting health care services, drugs,\nor supplies, or if a NYS Medicaid member commits fraudulent acts with their benefit card (i.e., forged prescriptions, card loaning, doctor shopping).\nOTP services including methadone maintenance treatment a"}
