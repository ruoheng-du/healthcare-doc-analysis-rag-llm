Everyone has a role to play; families talking with each other about their care preferences and\nwishes as well as health care providers helping patients to understand how to make sure their wishes are\nfollowed in a clinical setting.\nAdvance care planning is the process of communicating and documenting your wishes for medical treatment in\nthe event you are no longer able to speak for yourself. Through the advance care planning process, you may fill\nout advance directives or appoint a health care proxy to document your wishes. According to a national survey,\nninety percent of people say that talking to their loved ones about end-of-life care is important, yet only twenty-\nseven percent have actually done so (The Conversation Project National Survey, 2013).\nHere are some simple steps to can take to start your advance care planning process:\n1. Think about what matters to you. It can be helpful to prepare yourself before talking to others about\nadvance care planning. Think about what matters most to you and what you value.\n2. Start the conversation. Make time to talk with your loved ones, doctors, or other healthcare\nprofessionals about what matters to you and what type of medical treatment you would like if you were\nunable to speak for yourself. It may take one conversation, or it may take many, but starting the\nconversation about your wishes is often the hardest part.\n3. Fill out the forms. New York State advance directives include a Health Care Proxy and Medical Orders\nfor Life Sustaining Treatment (MOLST). While everyone over the age of 18 should have a Health Care\nProxy, a MOLST may not be appropriate for everyone. Typically, a MOLST is completed for someone\nwith a serious health condition and who:\n• wants to receive or avoid any or all life-sustaining treatment;\n• resides in a long-term care facility or requires long-term care services; and/or\n• may die within the next year.\n4. Review and revise. Advance care planning is a process. You can always update your advance care\ndirectives if your preferences have changed. Review the decisions you made periodically and discuss\nthem with your health care proxy and doctors to make sure everyone still understands your wishes.\nFor more information on advance care planning visit the New York State Department of Health web site at:\nhttps://www.health.ny.gov/professionals/patients/health_care_proxy/.\n\n[OCR Supplement]\nDepartment\nof Health\n\nNEW\nYORK\nMedicaid Update\n\nThe Official Newsletter of the New York State Medicaid Program\n\nAndrew M.

The exceptional circumstances for which this waiver applies are set forth below (excerpt\nof waiver):\nThe Department recognizes that the standards developed by the National Council for Prescription Drug\nPrograms (NCPDP), as adopted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), still do not address\nevery prescribing scenario. The current standards allow only a limited number of characters in the prescription\ndirections to the patient, including, but not limited to, taper doses, insulin sliding scales, and alternating drug\ndoses.\nSimilarly, for compound drugs, no unique identifier is available for the entire formulation. Typing the entire\ncompound on one text line may lead to prescribing or dispensing errors, potentially compromising patient safety.\nFurther, the Department is mindful that practitioners must issue non-patient specific prescriptions in\ncertain instances, and that such prescriptions cannot be properly entered into the electronic prescription\nsoftware.\nFor these reasons, pursuant to my authority in PHL § 281(3), I waive the requirements for electronic\nprescribing in the following exceptional circumstances:\n1. any practitioner prescribing a controlled or non-controlled substance, containing two (2) or more\nproducts, which is compounded by a pharmacist;\n2. any practitioner prescribing a controlled or non-controlled substance to be compounded for the direct\nadministration to a patient by parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous or intraspinal\ninfusion;\n3. any practitioner prescribing a controlled or non-controlled substance that contains long or complicated\ndirections;\n4. any practitioner prescribing a controlled or non-controlled substance that requires a prescription to\ncontain certain elements required by the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that are not\nable to be accomplished with electronic prescribing;\n5. any practitioner prescribing a controlled or non-controlled substance under approved protocols for\nexpedited partner therapy, collaborative drug therapy management or comprehensive medication\nmanagement, or in response to a public health emergency that would allow a non-patient specific\nprescription;\n6. any practitioner issuing a non-patient specific prescription for an opioid antagonist;\n7. any practitioner prescribing a controlled or non-controlled substance under a research protocol;\n8. a pharmacist dispensing controlled and non-controlled substance compounded prescriptions,\nprescriptions containing long or complicated directions, and prescriptions containing certain elements\nrequired by the FDA or any other governmental agency that are not able to be accomplished with\nelectronic prescribing;\nMarch 2019 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 5\n\n[OCR Supplement]\nPharmacy |\nPharmacy\n\n9. a pharmacist dispensing prescriptions issued under a research protocol, or under approved protocols\nfor expedited partner therapy, or for collaborative drug management or comprehensive medication\nmanagement; and\n10. a pharmacist dispensing non-patient specific prescriptions, including opioid antagonists, or\nprescriptions issued in response to a declared public health emergency.\nThis waiver is hereby issued for the ten (10) above-listed exceptional circumstances and shall be effective\nfrom March 25, 2019 through March 24, 2020. Before March 25, 2020, I will determine whether the software\navailable for electronic prescribing has sufficient functionality to accommodate each of these exceptional\ncircumstances.\nPractitioners issuing prescriptions in all the above-listed exceptional circumstances may use either the\nOfficial New York State Prescription Form or issue an oral prescription, provided, however, that oral prescriptions\nremain subject to PHL §§ 3334 and 3337, which provide for oral prescriptions of controlled substances in\nemergencies and for other limited purposes, and subject to section 6810 of the Education Law.
