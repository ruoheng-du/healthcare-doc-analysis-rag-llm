General Information\nPursuant to New York State (NYS) Public Health Law (PHL) Article 29-G, as recently amended, and\nSocial Services Law (SSL) Section 367-u, NYS Medicaid has expanded coverage of telehealth services\nto include:\n1. additional originating and distant sites;\n2. additional telehealth applications (store-and-forward technology, and remote patient monitoring);\nand\n3. additional practitioner types.\nThis article outlines NYS Medicaid's updated telehealth coverage and reimbursement policy. The\nfollowing information applies to Article 28 facilities and private practitioners. The Office of Mental Health\n(OMH), the Office for People with Developmental Disabilities (OPWDD), and the Office of Alcoholism\nand Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) are publishing separate guidance on telehealth and\nregulations that will align with state law and Medicaid payment policy for Medicaid enrollees being served\nunder their authority. Additional guidance on specialty consultations for OMH, OPWDD, and OASAS\nmembers will be forthcoming. This policy is effective January 1, 2019 for Medicaid Fee-for-Service (FFS)\nand March 1, 2019 for Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) plans. Nothing precludes implementation by the\nMMC Plans prior to January 1, 2019.\nDefinition of Telehealth\nTelehealth is defined as the use of electronic information and communication technologies to deliver\nhealth care to patients at a distance. Medicaid covered services provided via telehealth include\nassessment, diagnosis, consultation, treatment, education, care management and/or self-management\nof a Medicaid member. Telephone conversations, e-mail or text messages, and facsimile transmissions\nbetween a practitioner and a Medicaid member or between two practitioners are not considered\ntelehealth services and are not covered by Medicaid when provided as standalone services. Remote\nconsultations between practitioners, without a Medicaid member present, including for the purposes of\nteaching or skill building, are not considered telehealth and are not reimbursable. The acquisition,\ninstallation and maintenance of telecommunication devices or systems is not reimbursable.\nContinued on Page 3\n\nAndrew M. Cuomo\nGovernor\nState of New York\nHoward A.

General Information (continued)\nWhile NYS Medicaid has expanded coverage of telehealth services, such telehealth services should not\nbe used by a provider if they may result in any reduction to the quality of care required to be provided to\na Medicaid member or if such service could adversely impact the member. Telehealth is designed to\nimprove access to needed services and to improve member health. Telehealth is not available solely for\nthe convenience of the practitioner when a face-to-face visit is more appropriate and/or preferred by the\nmember.\nOriginating Site\nThe originating site is where the member is located at the time health care services are delivered to\nhim/her by means of telehealth. The originating site must be located within the fifty United States or\nUnited States’ territories. Originating sites previously included facilities licensed under Article 28 (general\nhospitals, nursing homes, and diagnostic and treatment centers) and private physician's or dentist's\noffices located within the state of New York.\nSince the last article on telehealth was published in the March 2015 Medicaid Update, several\noriginating sites have been added. The list now reads as follows:\n1. Facilities licensed under Article 28 of the PHL (general hospitals, nursing homes, and diagnostic\nand treatment centers);\n2. Facilities licensed under Article 40 of the PHL (hospice programs);\n3. Facilities as defined in Subdivision 6 of Section 1.03 of the Mental Hygiene Law (MHL) (includes\nclinics certified under Articles 16, 31 and 32);\n4. Certified and non-certified day and residential programs funded or operated by OPWDD;\n5. Private physician's or dentist's offices located within the state of New York;\n6. Any type of adult care facility licensed under Title 2 of Article 7 of the SSL;\n7. Public, private and charter elementary and secondary schools located within the state of New\nYork;\n8. School-age child care programs located within the state of New York;\n9. Child daycare centers located within the state of New York; and\n10. The member's place of residence located within the state of New York or other temporary location\nwithin or outside the state of New York.\nDistant Site\nThe distant site is any secure location within the fifty United States or United States’ territories where\nthe telehealth provider is located while delivering health care services by means of telehealth. Services\nprovided by means of telehealth must be in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and\nAccountability Act (HIPAA) and all other relevant laws and regulations governing confidentiality, privacy,\nand consent (including, but not limited to 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164 [HIPAA Security Rules]; 42 CFR\nPart 2; PHL Article 27-F; and MHL Section 33.13).\nSpecial Edition: Telehealth Expansion New York State Medicaid Update pg. 3\n\nB. Telehealth Applications (Telemedicine, Store-and-Forward,\nRemote Patient Monitoring)\nNYS Medicaid has covered both remote patient monitoring provided by Certified Home Health Agencies\n(CHHAs) for their patients and telemedicine for a number of years. At this time, NYS Medicaid is\nexpanding coverage of telehealth to include store-and-forward technology, additional originating sites,\nand additional practitioners.\nTelemedicine\nTelemedicine uses two-way electronic audio-visual communications to deliver clinical health care\nservices to a patient at an originating site by a telehealth provider located at a distant site. The totality\nof the communication of information exchanged between the physician or other qualified health care\npractitioner and the patient during the course of the synchronous telemedicine service must be of an\namount and nature that would be sufficient to meet the key components and/or requirements of the\nsame service when rendered via face-to-face interaction.\nStore-and-Forward Technology\nStore-and-forward technology involves the asynchronous, electronic transmission of a member's\nhealth information in the form of patient-specific pre-recorded videos and/or digital "}

Store-and-forward technology aids in diagnoses when live video or face-to-face contact is not\nreadily available or not necessary.\n2. Pre-recorded videos and/or static digital images (e.g., pictures), excluding radiology, must be\nspecific to the member's condition as well as be adequate for rendering or confirming a diagnosis\nor a plan of treatment.\nRemote Patient Monitoring\nRemote patient monitoring (RPM) uses digital technologies to collect medical data and other personal\nhealth information from members in one location and electronically transmit that information securely to\nhealth care providers in a different location for assessment and recommendations. Monitoring programs\ncan collect a wide range of health data from the point of care, such as vital signs, blood pressure, heart\nrate, weight, blood sugar, blood oxygen levels and electrocardiogram readings. RPM may include follow-\nup on previously transmitted data conducted through communication technologies or by telephone.\nFollow-up is included in the monthly time component (see Application-Specific Telehealth Billing Rules).\nThe following considerations apply to RPM:\n1. Medical conditions that may be treated/monitored by means of RPM include, but are not limited\nto, congestive heart failure, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, wound care,\npolypharmacy, mental or behavioral problems, and technology-dependent care such as\ncontinuous oxygen, ventilator care, total parenteral nutrition or enteral feeding.\n2. RPM must be ordered and billed by a physician, nurse practitioner or midwife, with whom the\nmember has or has entered into a substantial and ongoing relationship. RPM can also be\nprovided and billed by an Article-28 clinic, when ordered by one of the previously mentioned\nqualified practitioners.\n3. Members must be seen in-person by their practitioner, as needed, for follow-up care.\nSpecial Edition: Telehealth Expansion New York State Medicaid Update pg. 4\n\n4. RPM must be medically necessary and shall be discontinued when the member's condition is\ndetermined to be stable/controlled.\n5. Payment for RPM while a member is receiving home health services through a Certified Home\nHealth Agency (CHHA) is pursuant to PHL Section 3614 (3-c)(a) – (d) and will only be made to\nthat same CHHA.\nC. Telehealth Providers\nThis Medicaid Update article addresses the telehealth payment policy for the following provider\ntypes:\n1. Physicians;\n2. Physician assistants;\n3. Dentists;\n4. Nurse practitioners;\n5. Registered professional nurses (only when such nurse is receiving patient- specific health\ninformation or medical data at a distant site by means of RPM);\n6. Podiatrists;\n7. Optometrists;\n8. Psychologists;\n9. Social workers;\n10. Speech language pathologists;\n11. Audiologists;\n12. Midwives;\n13. Physical therapists;\n14. Occupational therapists;\n15. Certified diabetes educators;\n16. Certified asthma educators;\n17. Genetic counselors;\n18. Credentialed alcoholism and substance abuse counselors (CASAC) credentialed by OASAS or\nby a credentialing entity approved by such office pursuant to Section 19.07 of the MHL;\n19. Providers authorized to provide services and service coordination under the Early Intervention\n(EI) Program pursuant to Article 25 of PHL (Note: The EI Program will issue program-specific\nguidance regarding the use of and reimbursement for EI services delivered via telehealth.)\n20. Hospitals licensed under Article 28 of PHL, including residential health care facilities serving\nspecial needs populations;\n21. Home care services agencies licensed under Article 36 of PHL;\n22. Hospices licensed under Article 40 of PHL;\nSpecial Edition: Telehealth Expansion New York State Medicaid Update pg. 5\n\nRegulations will be forthcoming and will address telehealth payment policy for the following\nprovider types:\n23. Clinics licensed or certified under Article 16 of the MHL;\n24. Certified and non-certified day and residential programs funded or operated by the OPWDD; and\n25. Any other provider as determined by the Commissioner of Health pursuant to regulation or in\nconsultation with the Commissioner, by the Commissioner of OMH, the Commissioner of\nOASAS, or the Commissioner of OPWDD pursuant to regulation.\nThe following applies to practitioners providing services via telehealth:\n1. Practitioners providing services via telehealth must be licensed or certified, currently registered\nin accordance with NYS Education Law or other applicable law, and enrolled in NYS Medicaid.\n2. Telehealth services must be delivered by providers acting within their scope of practice.\n3. Reimbursement will be made in accordance with existing Medicaid policy related to supervision\nand billing rules and requirements.\n4. When services are provided by an Article 28 facility, the telehealth practitioner must be\ncredentialed and privileged at both the originating and distant sites in accordance with Section\n280"}

Confidentiality\nAll services delivered via telehealth must be performed on dedicated secure transmission linkages that\nmeet the minimum federal and state requirements, including but not limited to: 45 CFR Parts 160 and\n164 (HIPAA Security Rules); 42 CFR, Part 2; PHL Article 27-F; and MHL Section 33.13. Transmissions\nmust employ acceptable authentication and identification procedures by both the sender and the\nreceiver. Additionally:\n1. HIPAA requires that a written \"business associate agreement\" (BAA), or contract that provides\nfor privacy and security of protected health information (PHI) be in place between the telehealth\nprovider and the supporting telehealth vendor.\n2. Privacy must be maintained during all patient-practitioner interactions.\n3. All existing confidentiality requirements that apply to medical records (including, but not limited\nto: 45 CFR Part 160 and 164; 42 CFR Part 2; PHL Article 27-F, and MHL Section 33.13) shall\napply to services delivered by telehealth, including the actual transmission of service, any\nrecordings made during the telehealth encounter, and any other electronic records.\nE. Patient Rights and Consents\nThe practitioner shall provide the member with basic information about the services that he/she will be\nreceiving via telehealth and the member shall provide his/her consent to participate in services utilizing\nthis technology. Telehealth sessions/services shall not be recorded without the member's consent.\nCulturally competent translation and/or interpretation services must be provided when the member and\ndistant practitioner do not speak the same language. If the member is receiving ongoing treatment via\ntelehealth, the member must be informed of the following patient rights policies at the initial encounter.\nSpecial Edition: Telehealth Expansion New York State Medicaid Update pg. 6\n\nDocumentation in the medical record must reflect that the member was made aware of the policies\noutlined below.\nPatient rights policies must ensure that members receiving telehealth services:\n1. Have the right to refuse to participate in services delivered via telehealth and must be made\naware of alternatives and potential drawbacks of participating in a telehealth visit versus a face-\nto-face visit;\n2. Are informed and made aware of the role of the practitioner at the distant site, as well as qualified\nprofessional staff at the originating site who are going to be responsible for follow-up or ongoing\ncare;\n3. Are informed and made aware of the location of the distant site and all questions regarding the\nequipment, the technology, etc., are addressed;\n4. Have the right to have appropriately trained staff immediately available to them while receiving\nthe telehealth service to attend to emergencies or other needs;\n5. Have the right to be informed of all parties who will be present at each end of the telehealth\ntransmission; and\n6. Have the right to select another provider and be notified that by selecting another provider, there\ncould be a delay in service and the potential need to travel for a face-to-face visit.\nF. Failure of Transmission\nAll telehealth providers must have a written procedure detailing a contingency plan in the case of a\nfailure of transmission or other technical difficulty that renders the service undeliverable via telehealth.\nPolicies and procedures must be available upon audit. If the service is undelivered due to a failure of\ntransmission or other technical difficulty, a claim should not be submitted to Medicaid.\nG. Billing Rules for Telehealth Services\n1.

Place of Service (POS) Code to be Used when Billing for Telehealth Services\nPOS Code Description\n02 The location where health services and health-related services are provided or\nreceived, through telehealth telecommunication technology. When billing telehealth\nservices, providers must bill with place of service code 02 and continue to bill modifier\n95, GT or GQ.\n3. General Billing Guidelines\nOnly one clinic payment will be made when both the originating site and the distant site are part of the\nsame provider billing entity. In such cases, only the originating site should bill Medicaid for the\ntelemedicine encounter. The CPT code billed should be appended with the applicable modifier (GT or\n95). (e.g., Hospital X has multiple sites for primary and specialty care. A member at one of the primary\ncare sites requires a telemedicine consultation with a specialist located at a distant site within the system\nof Hospital X.)\nFor individuals with Medicare and Medicaid, if Medicare covers the telehealth encounter, Medicaid will\nreimburse the Part B coinsurance and deductible to the extent permitted by state law. If a service is\nwithin Medicare's scope of benefits (e.g., physician), but Medicare does not cover the service when\nprovided via telehealth, Medicaid will defer to Medicare's decision and will not cover the telehealth\nencounter at this time.\n4. Fee-for-Service Billing for Telemedicine by Site and Location\nWhen services are provided via telemedicine to a member located at an originating site as defined in\nSection A of this issue, the servicing provider should bill for the telemedicine encounter as if the provider\nsaw the member face-to-face in the office or Article 28 clinic setting using the appropriate billing rules\nfor services rendered. The CPT code for the encounter must be appended with the applicable modifier\n(95 or GT).\n4-a. Article 28 Clinic Originating Sites Billing Under Ambulatory Patient Groups (APG)\n1. Institutional Component (Originating Site)\na. When services are provided via telemedicine to a member located at an Article 28\noriginating site (outpatient department/clinic, emergency room), the originating site may\nbill only CPT code Q3014 (telehealth originating-site facility fee) through APGs to recoup\nadministrative expenses associated with the telemedicine encounter.\nSpecial Edition: Telehealth Expansion New York State Medicaid Update pg. 8\n\nb. When a separate and distinct medical service, unrelated to the telemedicine encounter,\nis provided by a qualified practitioner at the originating site, the originating site may bill\nfor the medical service provided in addition to Q3014. The CPT code billed for the\nseparate and distinct service must be appended with the 25 modifier.\n2. Practitioner (Professional) Component (Originating Site)\na. When the originating site is an Article 28 hospital (outpatient department/clinic,\nemergency room) and a physician is onsite assisting or attending to the member during\na telemedicine encounter, a physician claim cannot be billed to Medicaid.\nb. When a separate and distinct medical service, unrelated to the reason for the\ntelemedicine encounter, is provided by a physician at the originating site, the physician\nmay bill for the medical service provided. The CPT code billed for the separate and\ndistinct service must be appended with the 25 modifier. The professional component for\nall practitioner types, other than physicians, is included in the APG payment to the\noriginating-site facility.\nc. When the originating site is an Article 28 free-standing diagnostic and treatment center\n(DTC), the professional component for all practitioners, including physicians, is included\nin the APG payment to the facility.\n4-b.

When the distant-site practitioner is physically located at the Article 28 distant site, the\ndistant site may bill Medicaid under APGs for the telemedicine encounter using the\nappropriate CPT code for the service provided. The CPT code must be appended with\nthe applicable modifier (95 or GT). When the distant-site practitioner is not physically\nlocated on-site at the Article 28 facility, the distant site cannot submit an APG claim to\nMedicaid.\n2. Practitioner (Professional) Component (Distant Site)\na. When the distant site is an Article 28 hospital outpatient department/clinic and\ntelemedicine services are being provided by a physician, the physician should bill\nMedicaid using the appropriate CPT code for the service provided appended with the\napplicable modifier (95). The professional component for all practitioner types, other than\nphysicians, is included the APG payment to the distant-site facility.\nb.

FQHCs That Have Not \"Opted Into\" APGs - FQHC Originating Sites:\na. When services are provided via telemedicine to a patient located at an FQHC originating\nsite, the originating site may bill only the FQHC offsite services rate code (4012) to recoup\nadministrative expenses associated with the telemedicine encounter.\nb. When a separate and distinct medical service, unrelated to the telemedicine encounter,\nis provided by a qualified practitioner at the FQHC originating site, the originating site\nmay bill the Prospective Payment System (PPS) rate in addition to the FQHC offsite\nservices rate code (4012).\nc. If a provider who is onsite at an FQHC is providing services via telemedicine to a member\nwho is in their place of residence or other temporary location, the FQHC should bill the\nFQHC off-site services rate code (4012) and report the applicable modifier (95 or GT) on\nthe procedure code line.\nd. If the FQHC is providing services as a distant site provider, the FQHC may bill their PPS\nrate.\n5. Application-Specific Telehealth Billing Rules\nStore-and-Forward Technology\n1.

Telehealth and Value Based Payments (VBP)\nValue Based Payments (VBP) offer the opportunity to include and promote telehealth services to\nfacilitate practice workflow and efficiency, while increasing member and provider satisfaction. Services\ndelivered via telehealth may be particularly advantageous where access to specialty care, such as\npsychiatric care, is limited, when the member is unable to travel to the clinic/office due to a medical or\nbehavioral health condition, or where weather significantly impacts continuity of care, as examples. MMC\nplans and providers should work on ways to bundle telehealth services into VBP contracts to incentivize\nflexible use of telehealth as part of total cost of care, integrated primary care, and other population-or\nepisode-based arrangements.\nI.
