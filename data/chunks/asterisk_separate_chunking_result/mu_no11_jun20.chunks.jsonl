These OTC drugs include select medications in the following categories: analgesic and antipyretic,\nantacid, anti-diarrheal, antihistamine, anti-vertigo, artificial tears and ocular/oral lubricants, chronic renal\ndisease, cough and cold, dermatological, family planning, fecal softener and laxative, hematinic, insulin,\npediculicide, smoking cessation agents, and vitamins/minerals.\nAll categories are represented on the Medicaid Formulary, however, not every item made by every\nmanufacturer is covered. Furthermore, not all formulations and/or package sizes are covered. Quantities may\nalso be limited based on acute/episodic vs. chronic/maintenance uses. The following are some examples and\nhelpful information for prescribing and dispensing OTC items for Medicaid members:\nFormulation\nMany drugs have multiple types of formulations, such as gel and ointment. The list will have the form available\nfor coverage.\nExamples:\n• Ibuprofen tablets are covered, but capsules are not.\n• Hydrocortisone cream is covered but not when it contains aloe.\nPackaging and Quantity\nOTC drugs are generally covered in packaging and package sizes that are most cost effective. While\nprescribers may not know the package size that is covered, the dispensing pharmacist may choose the\npackage size available that most closely resembles"}

This may mean that there are slight\ndifferences in the quantities actually dispensed.\nExamples:\n• Polyethylene glycol 3350 is covered in bottles but not coverable in dose packets.\n• A prescriber writes a fiscal order for anti-diarrheal tablets for a quantity of 30 tablets, while the\npharmacist has access to package sizes of 18 and 24. The order could be appropriately dispensed as\n24 tablets in the prepackaged box or 30 tablets from a stock bottle. Alternatively, if the prescriber wrote\nfor calcium 500mg tablets quantity 60, it would be inappropriate for the pharmacist to dispense the\nentire 500 tablet stock bottle but a package size of 100 is permissible.\nMaintenance\nMaintenance OTC medications are ones that members take on a regular basis for a chronic need. Medicaid\nencourages prescribing maintenance OTC medications in appropriate quantities to reduce trips to the\npharmacy and to encourage compliance. Most maintenance medications are available to members up to a\n90-day supply.\nExamples:\n• Medication such as daily low dose aspirin for cardioprotection.\n• Medication such as daily insulin for diabetes.\nAcute Use\nAcute use OTC medications should be prescribed in the quantity and day supply to treat the one episode of\nthe acute event. Excessive quantities, those that exceed the amount generally needed to treat one episode\nof the acute event, and refills will not be covered for OTC drugs that are generally prescribed for acute use.\nExample:\n• Medication such as pseudoephedrine that is prescribed for a cold.\nJune 2020 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 3\n\nAdditional Information and Resources:\n• Pharmacies should submit the OTC medication claims for reimbursement according to fee-for-service\npayment methodology as found at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/docs/\npharmacy_reimbursement.pdf.\n• The list of covered OTC items, as well as the entire outpatient formulary, is updated on a daily basis\nand can be found at: https://www.emedny.org/info/formfile.aspx.\n• Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) plans may also have OTC drug policies.

Dental claims involving\nteledentistry and dental telephonic codes can only be considered if the claim submission meets specific\nrequirements.\nTelehealth is defined as the use of electronic information and communication technologies to deliver health\ncare to patients at a distance. Medicaid covered services provided via telehealth include assessment,\ndiagnosis, consultation, treatment, education, care management and/or self-management of a Medicaid\nmember. While New York State (NYS) is in the State of Emergency, this definition is expanded to include\ntelephone conversations. Therefore, during the State of Emergency, telehealth includes telephonic,\ntelemedicine, store and forward, and remote patient monitoring. Telemedicine includes teledentistry.\nTelemedicine/teledentistry is the term used in this guidance to denote two-way audiovisual communication\nto deliver clinical health care services to a patient at an originating site by a telehealth provider located at a\ndistant site.\nOriginating Site\nThe originating site is where the patient member is located at the time health care services are delivered by\nmeans of telehealth. Originating sites during the State of Emergency can be anywhere the patient member is\nlocated including the member's home. There are no limits on originating sites during the State of Emergency.\nThere is one procedure code applicable to the originating site – “Q3014” (see below). There may not be a\nbillable originating site (e.g. if a patient initiates an audiovisual connection with the dentist from their\nresidence).\n• “Q3014”- Telehealth Originating Site facility fee. Dentists enrolled in the NYS Medicaid Program\nwho initiate the service at the originating site may use procedure code “Q3014”.

During the State of Emergency any site within the fifty United States or United States'\nterritories is eligible to be a distant site for delivery and payment purposes, including Federally Qualified Health\nCenters (FQHC) and the provider’s home, for all patients including patients dually eligible for Medicaid and\nMedicare. The POS code – “02” must be used for the distant site. There are two procedure codes, “D9995”\nand “D9996”, applicable for use by the dentist at the distant site.\n“D9995” - Teledentistry – synchronous; real time encounter claim submission.\nThe following criteria apply:\n• “D9995” reimburses at $0.00.\n• “D9995” must not be reported as a stand-alone procedure.\n• “D9995” must be entered on line #1 of the claim.\n• All services rendered must be reported on subsequent claim lines.\n• Services rendered should be appropriate for telehealth (teledentistry) and within the provider's scope\nof practice.\n• Approvable services listed on subsequent lines reimburse at the fee listed on the NYS Medicaid Fee\nSchedule as per policy.\n• Claims may pend for manual review.\nJune 2020 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 6\n\nExample 1 - Dental Claim Submitted Correctly:\n “D9995” would be entered on claim line #1.\n There may be a fee listed for “D9995”; Medicaid will reimburse at $0.00.\n “D0140” is entered on claim line #2.\n There would be a fee of $14.00 or more entered for “D0140”; Medicaid will reimburse at the usual\nMedicaid fee of $14.00.\n This claim will reimburse a total of $14.00.\nExample 2 - Dental Claim Submitted Incorrectly:\n “D9995” entered on claim line #1.\n There may be a fee entered for “D9995”; Medicaid will reimburse at $0.00.\n No additional procedure codes listed on subsequent lines.\n This claim will reimburse at $0.00.\n Claims for “D9995” submitted as a stand-alone procedure may be denied by DOH to alert providers\nof this error.\nExample 3 - Dental Claim Submitted Incorrectly:\n “D0140” listed on claim line #1.\n “D9995” listed on claim line #2.\n This claim will be denied by DOH; “D9995” must be entered on claim line #1.\n“D9996” - Teledentistry – asynchronous; information stored and forwarded\nStore-and-forward technology involves the asynchronous, electronic transmission of a member's health\ninformation in the form of patient-specific pre-recorded videos and/or digital images from a provider at an\noriginating site to a telehealth provider at a distant site.\nStore-and-forward technology aids in diagnoses when live video or face-to-face contact "}
