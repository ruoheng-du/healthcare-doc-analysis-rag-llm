OTP services are delivered\nby programs certified as Article 32 outpatient programs by the Office of Addiction Services and Supports and\nare formerly known as Methadone Maintenance Treatment programs.\nThe goal of the RRP is to coordinate medical services and improve quality of care for NYS Medicaid members.\nCoordination of care reduces the potential over-utilization of health care services and prevents abusive or\nfraudulent behavior. The RRP may restrict the NYS Medicaid member to care provided by, or referred by, a\nprimary care provider, inpatient hospital, and/or primary pharmacy. A restriction is implemented if it is found\nthat the NYS Medicaid member has received a pattern of duplicative, excessive, contraindicated, or conflicting\nhealth care services, drugs, or supplies, or if a NYS Medicaid member commits fraudulent acts with their\nbenefit card (i.e., forged prescriptions, card loaning, doctor shopping).\nMarch 2025 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 7\n\nOTP services including methadone maintenance treatment are fully-exempt from all RRP coverage and\npayment restrictions. Consequently, all NYS Medicaid MMC Plans must cover medically necessary opioid\nuse disorder services delivered in an OTP for RRP-identified NYS Medicaid members without any additional\nRRP restrictions, edits, authorizations, or referral requirements, and claims for OTP services must not be\ndenied due to RRP restrictions.\nProvider Billing:\n• For FFS claims, Article 32 OTP providers are systemically assigned specialty code “922” in their\nprovider enrollment file and must utilize one of the following rate codes when submitting FFS claims:\n“1564”, “1567”, “7969” through “7976” (bundled rate codes), and “1671” / “2973” (Federally\nQualified Health Centers).

The\ninstitutionalized spouse is considered medically needy if their resources are at or below a certain level and\nthe monthly income after certain deductions is less than the cost of care in the facility. Federal and State laws\nrequire that spousal impoverishment rules be used to determine an institutionalized spouse’s eligibility for\nMedicaid. These rules protect some of the income and resources of the couple for the community spouse.\nPlease note: Spousal impoverishment rules do not apply to an institutionalized spouse who is eligible under\nthe Modified Adjusted Gross Income rules.\nIf you or your spouse are:\n1. In a medical institution or nursing facility and are likely to remain there for at least 30 consecutive days;\nor\n2. Receiving home and community-based services provided pursuant to a waiver under §1915(c) of the\nfederal Social Security Act and are likely to receive such services for at least 30 consecutive days; or\n3. Receiving institutional or non-institutional services and are enrolled in a Managed Long Term Care\nPlan; and\n4. Married to a spouse who does not meet any of the criteria set forth under items 1 through 3 listed\nabove, these income and resource eligibility rules for an institutionalized spouse may apply to you or\nyour spouse.\nIf you wish to discuss these eligibility provisions, please contact your local department of social services to\nrequest an assessment of the total value of your or your spouses combined countable resources, even if you\nhave no intention of pursuing a Medicaid application. It is to the advantage of the community spouse to request\nsuch an assessment to make certain that allowable resources are not depleted by you for your spouse’s cost\nof care. To request such an assessment, please contact your local department of social services or complete\nand mail the Request for Assessment – Spousal Impoverishment form (DOH-5298), located at:\nhttps://health.ny.gov/forms/doh-5298.pdf (see “Appendix” on page 13 page of this issue). New York City\nresidents may contact the Human Resources Administration Medicaid Helpline at (888) 692-6116.\nResource Information\nEffective January 1, 1996, the community spouse is allowed to keep resources in an amount equal to the\ngreater of the following amounts:\n1. $74,820.00 (the NYS minimum spousal resource standard); or\n2. $157,920.00 (the amount of the spousal share up to the maximum amount permitted under federal\nlaw for 2025).\nFor purposes of this calculation, “spousal share” is the amount equal to one-half of the total value of the\ncountable resources of you and your spouse at the beginning of the most recent continuous period of\ninstitutionalization of the institutionalized spouse. The most recent continuous period of institutionalization is\ndefined as the most recent period you and your spouse met the "}

The institutionalized spouse executes an assignment of support from the community spouse in favor\nof the social services district; or\n2. The institutionalized spouse is unable to execute such assignment due to physical or mental\nimpairment.\nIncome Contribution from the Community Spouse\nThe amount of money that Medicaid will request as a contribution from the community spouse will be based\non their income and the number of certain individuals in the community household depending on that income.\nMedicaid will request a contribution from a community spouse of 25 percent of the amount their otherwise\navailable income that exceeds the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance plus any family member\nallowance(s). If the community spouse feels that they cannot contribute the amount requested, the community\nspouse has the right to schedule a conference with the local department of social services to try to reach an\nagreement about the amount the community spouse is able to pay. Pursuant to Social Services Law\n§366(3)(a), located at: https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/SOS/366, Medicaid must be provided to the\ninstitutionalized spouse if the community spouse fails or refuses to contribute their income towards the\ninstitutionalized spouse’s cost of care. However, if the community spouse fails or refuses to make their income\navailable as requested, then the New York State Department of Health or the local department of social\nservices, at its option, may refer the matter to court for a review of the community spouse’s actual ability to\npay.\nMarch 2025 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 12\n\nRequest for Assessment – Spousal Impoverishment Form\n"}
