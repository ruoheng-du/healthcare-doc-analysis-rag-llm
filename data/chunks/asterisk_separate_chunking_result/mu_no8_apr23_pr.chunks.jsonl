Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) members may receive family planning and reproductive\nhealth services, including abortion services, from any qualified NYS Medicaid provider inside or outside their\nhealth plan, without prior approval from the health plan or primary care provider, as long as the provider\naccepts NYS Medicaid and offers the needed services.\nPrior approval (PA) is not required for any LARC, or other birth control method, device, or supply covered by\nNYS Medicaid FFS. NYS Medicaid FFS reimbursement for LARC is based on the acquisition cost of the\nprovider (actual, invoiced cost). For important claims processing rules, providers should refer to the\nReasonability Edits for Practitioner-Administered Drugs article published in the August 2015 issue of the\nMedicaid Update, located at: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2015/\naugust15_mu.pdf.

LARCs provided during an inpatient stay can be billed to NYS\nMedicaid on an ordered ambulatory claim, separate from the inpatient claim.

RRP is administered by the Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG) in\ncoordination with local Departments of Social Services (LDSS). The objectives of RRP include:\n• providing NYS Medicaid members with coordinated medical and pharmacy services, thus improving\nthe quality of their care;\n• reducing the inappropriate utilization of health care by identifying NYS Medicaid members exhibiting\nabusive or fraudulent behavior; and\n• utilizing Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) Plans and community providers to provide specific specialty\nand case management services. MMC Plans may add or modify restrictions only with the approval of\nOMIG.\nNYS Medicaid members who have been restricted as part of RRP to a designated health care provider\n(i.e., physician or clinic, hospital) or pharmacy are required to receive care only from the designated\nhealth care provider or pharmacy. A primary pharmacy is responsible for identifying the ordering prescriber\nand managing the delivery of medications.\nIt is important to remember that the primary health care provider, whether a physician, hospital, or clinic, is\nresponsible for the provision of most health care services for the restricted NYS Medicaid member. A referral\nwill be needed from these primary health care providers for any non-emergency medical services rendered\nby similar providers, including the ordering of transportation or prescriptions.\nWhen a restricted NYS Medicaid member is assigned to a designated provider and pharmacy, the provider\nand pharmacy will receive a letter informing them that the restricted NYS Medicaid member is restricted to\nthem. The letter also details the referral process. Additionally, the recipient is notified via the Notice of Intent\nto Restrict, which informs them of their restriction, their assigned providers, as well as their fair hearing\ninstructions.\nClaims submitted for a restricted NYS Medicaid member will be denied if the information of the\nprimary care provider is not included on the claim as the referring provider. Providers with questions\nregarding the submission of claims should contact eMedNY Provider Services at (800) 343-9000 or refer to\nthe provider manuals located on the eMedNY homepage, at: https://www.emedny.org/.\nBilling a Referral for a Restricted Recipient\nAs a result of the NYRx Pharmacy Benefit Transition, pharmacy services (outpatient prescriptions) for MMC\nenrollees are now being billed through NYRx, the NYS Medicaid Pharmacy Program, on a fee-for-service\n(FFS) basis.
