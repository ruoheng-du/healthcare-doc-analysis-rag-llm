Since inception of the PTPE process, the eMedNY “COVID\nFAQs” web page, located at: https://www.emedny.org/COVID19/FAQ/, has stated: “Within six months of the\nfederal public health emergency being lifted, New York State will cease payments to providers who are\ntemporarily enrolled unless a provider has submitted an application that meets all requirements for New York\nState Medicaid participation, and the application was reviewed and approved by the New York State\nDepartment of Health within six months of the federal public health emergency being lifted.”\nProviders who temporarily enrolled via the PTPE process must complete the full enrollment process by\nNovember 11, 2023, to continue participation in the program. Temporarily enrolled providers will be terminated\nand their NYS Medicaid payments will cease if they do not complete the enrollment process by November\n11, 2023. It can take up to 120 days to complete processing of an application; therefore, it is suggested that\napplications be submitted with enough time to ensure that they are processed by the November 11,\n2023 deadline.\nTo complete an application for full enrollment, providers should visit the eMedNY “Provider Enrollment &\nMaintenance” web page, located at: https://www.emedny.org/info/ProviderEnrollment/index.aspx.

For example, if the clinic was not able to bill the primary insurer for\na denture until the fourth visit of the NYS Medicaid member, the clinic (when submitting their claim to NYS\nMedicaid) would indicate the payment received from the primary/commercial insurer by inserting a “4” in the\n“units” field on the claim line for one of the CDT codes referenced above.

Automatic refills are not permitted. The policy surrounding refills can be found\nin the NYRx, the NY Medicaid Pharmacy Program: Pharmacy Manual – Policy Guidelines, located at:\nhttps://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/Pharmacy/PDFS/Pharmacy_Policy_Guidelines.pdf;\n• delivery charges may not be billed to the NYS Medicaid member or NYS Medicaid;\n• the pharmacy is responsible for preparing and delivering the drug in accordance with administration\nguidelines in the package insert, as well as the replacement of improperly stored, lost, or stolen drugs\nuntil confirmed receipt by the authorized agent;\n• the pharmacy is required to obtain documentation of delivery by the receipt of a signature of an\nauthorized agent at the site of administration;\n• all NYS Medicaid claims for drugs that were not deliverable must be reversed within 60 days; and\n• once delivered and signed for, the site of administration is responsible for replacement of improperly\nstored, handled, lost, or stolen PADs.\n“Brown bagging” is when drugs designated for self-administration or practitioner administration are\ndispensed directly to a patient by the pharmacy. Brown bagging PADs causes concern regarding proper\nstorage or handling, which can affect the efficacy of the drug. Brown bagging is acceptable only when the\ndrug is intended, prescribed, or labeled for self-administration. Prescribers should use their professional\njudgement to determine the best method for NYS Medicaid members to obtain PADs. It is the responsibility\nof the pharmacist to ensure white or brown bagged drugs are appropriately dispensed.\nProviders must follow NYS Medicaid policy for delivery of medications, including proof of delivery\ndocumentation. Information regarding delivery requirements may be found in the NYRx, the NY Medicaid\nPharmacy Program: Pharmacy Manual – Policy Guidelines, located at: https://www.emedny.org/Provider\nManuals/Pharmacy/PDFS/Pharmacy_Policy_Guidelines.pdf. This policy refers to any drug being dispensed\nby a pharmacy for practitioner-administration, including those billed as a secondary payment.\nQuestions and Additional Information:\nNYS M"}
