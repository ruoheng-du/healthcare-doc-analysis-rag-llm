The November\n2021 issue of the Medicaid Update article titled Reminder: NYS Requires Coordination of Benefits, located\nat: https://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/medicaid/program/update/2021/no13_2021-11.htm#cob, directed\nproviders to exhaust all existing benefits prior to billing the Medicaid program. If a Medicaid member has third-\nparty insurance coverage, the benefits of that coverage must be fully used before billing the NYS Medicaid\nprogram. Providers should always ask a Medicaid member if they have other third-party coverage to ensure\nthe proper coordination of benefits.\nAll claims submitted for members with Medicare and/or other third-party insurance must accurately reflect\npayments and denials received from other insurers to allow correct calculation of Medicaid reimbursement\namounts. The Explanation of Benefits (EOB), along with other documentation supporting Medicare with third-\nparty reimbursement amounts, must be kept, and then made available upon request for audit or inspection\nby the NYS Department of Health (DOH), the Office of the Medicaid Inspector General (OMIG), the Office of\nthe State Comptroller (OSC), or other state or federal agencies responsible for audit functions.\nAdditionally, for any claims submitted to Medicaid with zero-fill reimbursement from Medicare or third-party\ninsurers, providers must retain evidence that the claims were initially billed to Medicare and/or third-party\ninsurers and then were denied before seeking reimbursement from Medicaid. The exception to this policy, in\nwhich providers may bill Medicaid directly without first receiving denials, is for items that are statutorily not\ncovered by the Medicare program. Providers are responsible for retaining the statutory exemptions from\nMedicare for audit or inspection.\nPlease note: When submitting an EOB, or other member related data, providers must ensure they are only\nsubmitting data relevant to the Medicaid member. All other patient information must be redacted prior to\nsubmission. It is important to ensure that you are not submitting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or\nProtected Health Information (PHI) of non-Medicaid members to Medicaid.\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• Fee-for-service (FFS) claim questions should be directed to the eMedNY Call Center at\n(800) 343-9000.\n• FFS coverage and policy questions should be directed to the Office of Health Insurance Programs\n(OHIP) Division of Program Development and Management (DPDM) by telephone at (518) 473-2160\nor by email at FFSMedicaidPolicy@health.ny.gov.\n• Specific medical pended claims questions should be directed to the Bureau of Medical Review Pended\nClaims Unit at (800) 342-3005 (Option 3).\n• Medicaid Managed Care (MMC) reimbursement, billing, and/or documentation requirement questions\nshould be directed to enrollees MMC Plan.\n• MMC P"}

Per\ntheir communication, “[t]he FDA recommends that patients and health care providers discuss the benefits and\nrisks of all prenatal genetic testing, including NIPS tests, with a genetic counselor or other health care provider\nbefore considering such testing or making any decisions about their pregnancy.”\nProviders can refer to the FDA “Genetic Non-Invasive Prenatal Screening Tests May Have False Results:\nFDA Safety Communication” web page, located at: https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-\ncommunications/genetic-non-invasive-prenatal-screening-tests-may-have-false-results-fda-safety-\ncommunication, for a full-list of recommendations for patients and providers.\nApril 2022 New York State Medicaid Update pg. 5\n\nReminders:\n• Genetic counseling is covered by Medicaid and should be provided to pregnant members prior to non-\ninvasive prenatal testing to weigh benefits versus risks. Genetic counseling must also be provided to\nthose who test positive for a fetal chromosomal abnormality.\n• Prenatal testing of a fetus by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling will continue to be covered:\nsubsequent to a positive or high-risk score on a NIPS test; or\nsubsequent to an inconclusive test result in a high-risk pregnancy.\n• Diagnostic testing (e.g., cytogenetic analysis or molecular genetic testing) for suspected aneuploidies\ncontinues to be covered if medically necessary.\n• Cell-free fetal DNA testing should not be offered to members who are pregnant with three or more\nfetuses because it has not been sufficiently evaluated in these groups.\n• Micro-deletion testing, in conjunction with non-invasive trisomy testing, is not reimbursable.\nQuestions and Additional Information:\n• Consistent with existing policy, NYS Regulations at 18 New York Codes, Rules and Regulations\n(NYCRR) §505.7(g)(4) requires providers to order tests, individually. No payment will be made for\ntests ordered as groupings or combinations of tests. For more information and for additional\nregulations pertaining to laboratory services, providers should visit the NYCRR “Title: Section 505.7 -\nLaboratory Services” web page, located at: https://regs.health.ny.gov/content/section-5057-\nlaboratory-services.\n• FFS billing and claim questions should be directed to the eMedNY Call Center at (800) 343-9000.\n• FFS coverage and policy questions should be directed to the Office of Health Insurance Programs\n(OHIP), Division of Program Development and Management (DPDM), by telephone at (518) 473-2160\nor by email at FFSMedicaidPolicy@health.ny.gov.\n• MMC reimbursement, billing, and/or documentation requirement questions should be directed to\nenrollee MMC Plans.\n• MMC Plan contact information can be found in the eMedNY New York State Medicaid Program\nInformation for All Providers Managed Care Information document, located at:\nhttps://www.emedny.org/ProviderManuals/AllProviders/PDFS/Information_for_All_Providers_Manag\ned_Care_Information.pdf.\n"}
