From the project root directory, run:

```
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

You should see output like:

```
Local URL: http://localhost:8501
Network URL: http://192.168.x.x:8501
```

Open the Local URL in your browser to use the assistant.

When you’re done, go back to the terminal where it’s running and press:

```
Ctrl + C
```

to stop the Streamlit server.
